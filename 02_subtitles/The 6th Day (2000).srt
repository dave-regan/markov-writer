1
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,130
This is Johnny Phoenix for the XFL...

2
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,690
...reminding fans here at Prudential
Stadium to be safe on the way home.

3
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,530
Big third down
for the expansion Roadrunners.

4
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:12,450
The playoff hopes hinge on this play.
A lot of pressure on Johnny Phoenix.

5
00:02:12,651 --> 00:02:16,331
As if being the first quarterback to
earn $300 million isn't enough.

6
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,931
Red! Thirty-two!

7
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,971
Red! Thirty-two!

8
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,651
Run left!

9
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:35,291
Blue! Two, thirty-nine!

10
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,451
Blue!

11
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,772
Hut!

12
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:12,852
Get up, Johnny!

13
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:14,172
You all right?

14
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:19,173
The owner wants the best of care.

15
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,132
He'll need it. His 6th cervical
vertebra is crushed.

16
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,732
It may not be as bad
as you think it is.

17
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:36,813
The status? We have a lifetime
contract with a vegetable.

18
00:03:37,253 --> 00:03:39,133
Maybe we could trade him to L.A.

19
00:03:40,612 --> 00:03:43,173
Okay, I want you
to terminate his contract.

20
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:45,813
Sure.

21
00:03:46,013 --> 00:03:47,253
I'll get right on it.

22
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:51,053
Sorry, Johnny. You're going
to have to take one for the team.

23
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:12,894
Do I look any different to you?

24
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:15,814
Oh, gee.

25
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:17,894
You shaved your mustache.

26
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:19,494
I never had a mustache.

27
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,294
Then, no.

28
00:04:23,534 --> 00:04:25,454
Johnny Phoenix will play next week.

29
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,734
Early diagnosis had him sidelined...

30
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,374
...but his injuries proved
to be minor.

31
00:04:30,654 --> 00:04:34,215
Good morning, Adam. At 11:00 you
have a VIP client, Michael Drucker.

32
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:36,174
And by the way, happy birthday.

33
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,655
I don't feel different.

34
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,615
- Is Clara up yet?
- She's watching TV with Oliver.

35
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:47,694
Are you gonna spend all day
looking for wrinkles...

36
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:50,454
...or are you going to get in here
and give me a kiss?

37
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:52,335
I suppose if I have to.

38
00:04:53,535 --> 00:04:56,614
Bully! No, you're not getting
any kisses now.

39
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:00,775
You know, you don't look
any different.

40
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,655
No. You look much better
than when we met.

41
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,215
I love you.

42
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:11,816
Lock the door.

43
00:05:12,015 --> 00:05:13,375
Oh, God.

44
00:05:15,295 --> 00:05:17,335
Daddy! Daddy! Happy birthday!

45
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,496
You always make Daddy feel so good.

46
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:22,936
You're getting a little old for that.

47
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,136
I am not.

48
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,936
I meant your father.

49
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,575
- Very funny.
- Come on. I made you breakfast.

50
00:05:28,776 --> 00:05:30,736
- Oh, great. I love it.
- Come on, Dad!

51
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,095
I can't find you. Where are you?

52
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:35,136
I'm right behind you, Dad.

53
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:36,616
Hiding under the table.

54
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:42,016
Because of shorter life spans,
these family members break our hearts.

55
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:46,416
Should accident, illness or age
end your pet's natural life...

56
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:50,456
...our genetic technology can have him
back the same day in perfect health...

57
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:54,416
...with zero defects, guaranteed.
Thanks to RePet.

58
00:05:57,337 --> 00:05:59,616
Nacho-flavored or regular?

59
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,216
I'll take banana-flavored. Thank you.

60
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:05,336
I love this card. Beautiful.

61
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:08,577
Dad, can I have a Sim-Pal
for your birthday?

62
00:06:08,857 --> 00:06:10,337
You want a gift on my birthday?

63
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,897
So you won't feel guilty
you're the only one getting something.

64
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,457
- What's a Sim-Pal?
- A life-size doll.

65
00:06:16,657 --> 00:06:19,377
A make-believe friend
that grows real hair...

66
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:22,017
...and can do a lot of stuff.

67
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:26,097
Can't your real friends grow real hair
and do lots of stuff?

68
00:06:26,298 --> 00:06:28,377
Yeah, but they all have Sim-Pals.

69
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:29,657
Ask your mommy.

70
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:31,697
You're the greatest, Dad.

71
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:37,057
Mommy! Mommy!
I'm gonna get a Sim-Pal!

72
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,258
You are getting low on milk.

73
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:49,618
Thank you for ordering milk.

74
00:06:50,858 --> 00:06:52,778
You're getting so fast.

75
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,538
Into the car.

76
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:56,618
Very nice. Bye-bye.

77
00:06:56,938 --> 00:06:58,498
See you.

78
00:07:03,178 --> 00:07:04,418
What's going on?

79
00:07:04,618 --> 00:07:06,978
I had a breakfast of champions today.

80
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,978
Destination Double X Charter Airport
selected.

81
00:07:10,218 --> 00:07:13,218
She wouldn't stop talking.
My virtual girlfriend talks...

82
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:14,699
...but I can turn her off.

83
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,459
You and your virtual girls.

84
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:20,819
You're a grown man, and your primary
relationship is with software.

85
00:07:21,019 --> 00:07:24,299
If your senses say there's a hot
chick on your lap, there is one.

86
00:07:24,498 --> 00:07:26,938
I don't have to look any further.

87
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:31,579
They invented the Laser Razor.
No nicks or cuts. You should use it.

88
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:35,659
I like the old-fashioned kind.
They remind me I'm still alive.

89
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,219
You want to hang out at Kelly's
after work?

90
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,859
I know that Natalie is throwing me
a surprise party.

91
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,579
- Why do you say that?
- I told her you told.

92
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:47,340
- No, you didn't.
- Oh, yes.

93
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,740
Why did you do that?

94
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,699
I didn't. I just wanted to know
and now I know.

95
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:52,859
I was that easy.

96
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,220
Your destination, Double X Charter
Airport, is ahead.

97
00:07:56,899 --> 00:07:59,660
OnStar will now disengage
automatic drive.

98
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:01,300
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

99
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,259
Manual drive engaged.

100
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,340
Do me a favor at the party.

101
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,780
Don't get drunk and set the drapes on
fire? You already told me.

102
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,500
That too.

103
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,020
What I was going to say was
around 11:30...

104
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,220
...I want you to start singing really
loud, " Happy Birthday. "

105
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,220
- For what?
- The way you sing...

106
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,900
...it'll clear the place.

107
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,621
I get it. You and Natalie have
a little private party planned.

108
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,501
Good morning, Rosie.
Good morning, everybody.

109
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,541
Henry checked out the remote.
Says you'll love it.

110
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,100
They came in.

111
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,860
This is great. Look at this.

112
00:08:38,621 --> 00:08:41,141
And Drucker's office called.
Guess what?

113
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,221
They canceled.

114
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,901
No. We're going to be tested
for drugs and alcohol.

115
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,781
So? Oh, this is cool.

116
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:49,621
We're going to be tested?

117
00:08:49,861 --> 00:08:52,621
Not you guys. Just us pilots.

118
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:55,941
Look at this. The new remote came in.
Out goes the old one.

119
00:08:56,181 --> 00:09:00,421
Get rid of it! Adam, this is Tripp.
It's his first time with us.

120
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:01,901
- Welcome.
- How you doing?

121
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:03,781
Adam? Natalie's on line one.

122
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,822
What's up, honey? You look upset.

123
00:09:12,662 --> 00:09:13,622
Oh, Adam.

124
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:16,662
I just talked to the vet...

125
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:18,862
...and they had to put Oliver
to sleep.

126
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:20,422
What? He wasn't that sick.

127
00:09:20,622 --> 00:09:23,782
I know, I know. But apparently
he had some kind of...

128
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,982
...highly infectious virus. They
had to put him down. It's the law.

129
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:29,862
Oliver was licking Clara's face.

130
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,302
Don't worry.
I asked the same thing...

131
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:35,982
...and the virus is harmless
to humans. So, she's fine.

132
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:38,302
This'll break her heart,
you know that.

133
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,063
No, it won't.

134
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,823
I want you to go down to RePet...

135
00:09:44,462 --> 00:09:46,182
...and get Oliver replaced.

136
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:50,263
I'm not going to have some freak of
science sleep in my daughter's bed.

137
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:51,982
- It's not dangerous.
- No.

138
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,823
Oliver can live in our memories.

139
00:09:54,022 --> 00:09:56,423
She's only 8.
She won't understand that.

140
00:09:56,742 --> 00:09:58,623
It's the natural process of life.

141
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:02,063
You're born, you live and you die.
She has to learn about it.

142
00:10:02,303 --> 00:10:04,663
But not on your birthday.

143
00:10:04,863 --> 00:10:06,023
I appreciate that.

144
00:10:06,703 --> 00:10:08,382
- Will you do it?
- No.

145
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,183
Thank you. And Clara thanks you.

146
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:12,223
- Love you. Bye.
- Natalie, I won't-

147
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,183
Double X Charter.
Your passport to adventure.

148
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:16,423
No use fighting.

149
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,983
We always win.

150
00:10:20,984 --> 00:10:24,264
For incredible skiing and
snowboarding, Double X Charter.

151
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:29,064
- Tripp, you can go in this one.
- You got it.

152
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:30,824
You guys come with me.

153
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,344
Let's go!

154
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:43,784
Man, this is gonna be so great!

155
00:10:45,864 --> 00:10:48,504
9747, you are cleared for takeoff.

156
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:10,664
Everyone has their maps?

157
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:13,144
GPS? Emergency beacons?

158
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:15,265
Good. Any questions?

159
00:11:15,464 --> 00:11:18,425
I got a question.
How many of you have RePets?

160
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:21,145
- I have a dog.
- I got a snake.

161
00:11:21,345 --> 00:11:23,905
- At least know somebody who has one?
- I get your point.

162
00:11:24,145 --> 00:11:26,705
- I know somebody.
- I was just asking.

163
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,945
You scared me.

164
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:35,505
- You proud of yourself?
- Very.

165
00:11:35,705 --> 00:11:37,145
See you guys!

166
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,946
I know you're old-school, but all the
kids today grew up with RePets.

167
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:50,025
These days it's totally normal.

168
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:51,386
Not to me.

169
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:55,146
Not to you? You want her crying
all night because her dog died?

170
00:11:55,346 --> 00:11:56,306
Where's your heart?

171
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:59,225
- Don't you think it's a little creepy?
- No.

172
00:12:00,226 --> 00:12:01,186
I don't.

173
00:12:02,146 --> 00:12:04,146
Let's test the remote. Keep up.

174
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,066
All righty. Here we go.

175
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:16,946
These RePets come back, you can't
tell the difference. Trust me.

176
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:18,866
- I had it done.
- Bullshit.

177
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:25,026
I'm serious!
Sadie, my cat... she's a RePet.

178
00:12:25,267 --> 00:12:26,386
You had her cloned?

179
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:29,266
Well, she fell out of my condo window.

180
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,228
- You did well.
- Thank you.

181
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,228
How long are you to keep me?

182
00:13:09,428 --> 00:13:10,508
Till 7. Why?

183
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,347
Maybe I should check out RePet.

184
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,588
Good morning.
Are you gentlemen the owners?

185
00:13:31,789 --> 00:13:33,388
Yep, that's us.

186
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:36,668
Excellent. Larry Stern,
I'm with Mr. Drucker's advance team.

187
00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:41,268
I've got a contract here. You'll find
it pretty standard except for...

188
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,709
- Who was flying that one?
- Me, with the remote control.

189
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:49,669
We can fly four of these
between the two of us now.

190
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:51,749
- Amazing.
- You here for the blood test?

191
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,749
No. My technician is set up
in your office.

192
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,229
These forms are standard except what?

193
00:13:57,429 --> 00:14:00,069
It has a nondisclosure clause.
During the flight...

194
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,389
...you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.

195
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,149
Anything from big mergers...

196
00:14:04,349 --> 00:14:06,829
...to inside information
on his sports teams.

197
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:09,669
We have a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.

198
00:14:09,869 --> 00:14:11,989
This guy think he's the president?

199
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,589
He considers her to be the world's
second most important person.

200
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,070
That's big stuff.

201
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,270
All for a day of snowboarding?

202
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,790
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, I was screaming.

203
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:28,469
She's kidding. Don't worry about it.

204
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,870
It doesn't hurt.
Press your thumb here.

205
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,750
- Right here?
- Just like that.

206
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,030
- All done.
- Didn't feel a thing.

207
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:39,190
Now your vision.
Place your chin here.

208
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:40,670
Right here?

209
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,910
Do you blood-test all your pilots?

210
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,991
Pilots, drivers, security, assistants.

211
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,350
Basically, anyone who comes
in contact with Mr. Drucker.

212
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,951
I press here?

213
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,030
And here.

214
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:04,071
Perfect, both of you.

215
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:07,830
After this, I'm going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.

216
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,551
The pink copy of the charter contract
is yours.

217
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:13,990
I'll take the rest.

218
00:15:14,231 --> 00:15:16,551
- Here we go.
- Have a nice flight, gentlemen.

219
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:23,712
I can take Drucker. That way,
you'll have time to get Oliver cloned.

220
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:26,911
I'm not getting the dog cloned.
I'm just gonna check it out.

221
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,752
I know, but once you see it,
you'll say yes.

222
00:15:29,951 --> 00:15:31,792
Deep down inside, you're a softy.

223
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,672
They specifically asked for Adam
by name.

224
00:15:34,871 --> 00:15:38,431
I know. I also know that the
bodyguards can't tell the difference.

225
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,432
They never got our names.

226
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,072
That's true.

227
00:15:42,352 --> 00:15:45,951
Adam, I know I screw around a lot,
but when it comes to flying...

228
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:47,912
...you know I'm serious.
I could do it.

229
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,272
Go enjoy your birthday.

230
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:54,312
If you want to be me, try to act
a little bit more manly.

231
00:15:54,712 --> 00:15:57,032
Chest out. Stomach in.
There you are.

232
00:15:57,232 --> 00:15:58,592
All right.

233
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:06,712
- All clear.
- I want the Speaker of the House.

234
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:09,272
Don't mention my name at all.

235
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,793
I'm Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.

236
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:15,072
Adam's the name and flying's the game.

237
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:18,033
Pete Hume says you know the mountains
like nobody else.

238
00:16:18,232 --> 00:16:20,832
That's probably true for everyone
except my partner.

239
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,633
I'm looking forward to it.

240
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,873
- We all set?
- We've stationed our people-

241
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,993
- Don't need the details.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,313
Your snowboard's behind your seat.

243
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:33,833
Dave, look, we gave a lot of money
to his campaign...

244
00:16:34,033 --> 00:16:37,393
...not to mention what I pay
your law firm, so I'm counting on you.

245
00:16:37,593 --> 00:16:38,593
Get me the Speaker.

246
00:16:39,233 --> 00:16:40,433
Good.

247
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,153
Sally, who's next? Okay, put him on.

248
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:14,594
Hey, you own the Roadrunners, right?

249
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:31,154
Hey, buddy, wake up.

250
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:32,515
Wake up.

251
00:17:33,074 --> 00:17:34,435
We're here. Woodland Mall.

252
00:17:45,275 --> 00:17:46,315
I was asleep.

253
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:54,515
Welcome to Woodland Mall.
Over 1200 retail outlets to serve you.

254
00:17:54,915 --> 00:17:59,355
Food court, ground level.
Megaplex theater, 15th level.

255
00:17:59,555 --> 00:18:03,555
Stop the cloning. Say no to RePet.

256
00:18:03,755 --> 00:18:05,075
Stop the cloning.

257
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,715
God doesn't want you to go in there.

258
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,435
Then God shouldn't have killed my dog.

259
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:11,915
Atheist.

260
00:18:13,636 --> 00:18:16,435
We can clone your four-legged
loved one in a few hours.

261
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:17,955
How can we do it?

262
00:18:18,196 --> 00:18:20,316
It begins with growing "blanks"...

263
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,875
...animal drones
stripped of characteristic DNA...

264
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,755
...in embryonic tanks
at the RePet factory.

265
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,436
In stage two, your pet's DNA...

266
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:30,356
...is extracted from a lock of fur
or a drop of blood...

267
00:18:30,716 --> 00:18:33,557
...then infused on a cellular level
into the blank.

268
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:37,397
In the final stage, using RePet's
cerebral syncording process...

269
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:40,117
...all your pets thoughts,
memories and instincts...

270
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:42,556
...are transplanted
via the optic nerve.

271
00:18:43,837 --> 00:18:45,916
Still can't make up your mind, huh?

272
00:18:47,596 --> 00:18:49,396
You lost a dog, right?

273
00:18:50,157 --> 00:18:51,357
Yes, my daughter's.

274
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,117
What a heartbreak.

275
00:18:53,316 --> 00:18:56,356
- What did you say was his name again?
- Oliver.

276
00:18:56,597 --> 00:18:58,437
Oliver's in luck...

277
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,637
...because we're having
a special this week, 20 percent off.

278
00:19:01,836 --> 00:19:04,277
- When did Oliver die?
- This morning.

279
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,637
Perfect.
We can do a post-mortem syncording...

280
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:10,237
...but act fast because there's
a 12-hour window on deceased brains.

281
00:19:10,437 --> 00:19:12,477
I have a problem with the whole idea.

282
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,518
Suppose the clones have no soul
or they're dangerous?

283
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,357
Clone pets are every bit
as safe as real pets.

284
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:19,638
Plus...

285
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:20,837
...they're insured.

286
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:22,358
If it's so safe...

287
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,157
...then why is it against the law
to clone humans?

288
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:27,998
Because the human brain is too
complicated to syncord.

289
00:19:28,238 --> 00:19:30,077
You remember the experiment they did?

290
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,957
That's why it didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.

291
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,957
But with pets, it's a totally
proven technology.

292
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:40,478
Your RePet Oliver
will be exactly the same dog.

293
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:42,638
He'll know the tricks
you taught him...

294
00:19:42,837 --> 00:19:46,438
...where the bones are buried-
He won't even know he's a clone.

295
00:19:47,198 --> 00:19:48,518
And did I mention...

296
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,959
...they're insured.

297
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:51,638
I don't care about insurance.

298
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:55,198
I care if I can trust my daughter
with an animal with sharp teeth.

299
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:58,558
We can make him smaller.
With softer teeth.

300
00:19:58,758 --> 00:19:59,718
You can?

301
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:03,558
We can even color-coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.

302
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,719
Sim-Pals, the best friend
money can buy.

303
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,359
Let me think about that.

304
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:09,919
- who's fun to be with.
Treat your kids-

305
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:12,159
Look, I might be back.

306
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,039
You'll be back.

307
00:20:14,278 --> 00:20:16,318
Your daughter will think
you're the best.

308
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:19,759
- My sister has two and loves them.
- Good.

309
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:21,399
Come, let's fix the collar.

310
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,919
There you are.

311
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:25,319
- It's amazing how real this is.
- I know.

312
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,159
My daughter will be so excited.

313
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,919
Come, let's go home.

314
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
You have called Hank Morgan.

315
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,200
Hi, I'm not here, so leave a message.

316
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:40,759
Hank, it's me again.

317
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,800
What happened to you? I waited at
Kelly's for half an hour. It's now...

318
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:49,200
- ... five past 7.
- I'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?

319
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:52,560
I'm heading home now.
If you get this message-

320
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's be friends.

321
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,440
What's your name?

322
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,840
Can't you see I'm talking? Quiet.

323
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,720
- head to my house with flowers and a
good excuse, or Natalie will kill you.

324
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,720
I can sing songs.
Would you like to sing with me?

325
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,241
Excuse me, do you know how
to turn this off?

326
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,760
My niece has one.
Say, "Go to sleep, Cindy. "

327
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,801
- Go to sleep, Cindy.
- Would you like to sing...

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,400
Go to sleep.

329
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,200
Thank you. Thanks for the ride.

330
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:29,761
Good night.

331
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,961
Clara, sweetie, honey.

332
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,161
Oliver was very sick and he had to be
put down.

333
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:52,001
Clara, sweetie, honey. Oliver
had to go to heaven.

334
00:21:52,961 --> 00:21:54,121
"Why, Daddy?"

335
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:56,802
Well, you see, because...

336
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,682
...it's because, uh...

337
00:22:00,522 --> 00:22:02,562
Shit, Oliver! Why'd you have to die?

338
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,242
Oliver?

339
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,361
Natalie.

340
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:38,842
One...

341
00:22:39,203 --> 00:22:40,723
...two, three!

342
00:22:46,522 --> 00:22:48,683
That's amazing. Look at this cake!

343
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,643
Oh, my God.

344
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,603
Adam Gibson?

345
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:17,363
Who are you?

346
00:23:17,764 --> 00:23:20,084
We have a situation.
Come with us, please.

347
00:23:21,044 --> 00:23:22,603
What the hell is going on?

348
00:23:22,804 --> 00:23:24,884
Cooperate and everything will be fine.

349
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:29,884
Fine? Someone's in my house, eating
my birthday cake and it's not me!

350
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:34,084
We know. There's been a 6th Day
violation. A human was cloned.

351
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:37,004
- That human was you.
- We can help.

352
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:40,164
- Then get him out!
- But you'll have to come with us.

353
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:44,484
I don't know who the hell
you people are...

354
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:47,164
- ... but I'm going in my house.
- Right.

355
00:23:58,004 --> 00:23:59,924
Oops. Cindy fell down.

356
00:24:00,204 --> 00:24:01,564
Get the doll.

357
00:24:06,525 --> 00:24:07,605
Not here.

358
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,765
I'm Sim-Pal Cindy. What's your name?

359
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,206
I can play games.

360
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:41,406
Shit.

361
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:47,726
Wiley, no! Hold your fire!

362
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:49,046
That way! Go!

363
00:24:49,326 --> 00:24:50,645
Vincent, go!

364
00:24:50,966 --> 00:24:52,886
I have a boo-boo.

365
00:25:09,606 --> 00:25:10,887
Stop the car!

366
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:12,687
Stop the car!

367
00:25:15,527 --> 00:25:17,447
Thanks for the suggestion!

368
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:20,087
Don't even blink.

369
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,647
Oh, God. Someone stole the minivan.

370
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,887
No, they stole my Cadillac.

371
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,167
Oh, no.

372
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,087
Car chase. Cool.

373
00:25:40,968 --> 00:25:43,047
- Who are you?
- I was hired to kill you.

374
00:25:43,447 --> 00:25:45,247
That's all I know.

375
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,527
I'm Sim-Pal Cindy.
What's your name?

376
00:25:49,767 --> 00:25:51,248
Secure child-seat restraint.

377
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:52,888
Let's be friends.

378
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,848
- Where is this guy?
- I'm Sim-Pal Cindy.

379
00:26:12,808 --> 00:26:14,088
Let's be friends.

380
00:26:14,528 --> 00:26:15,768
What's your name?

381
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:18,368
Will you be my mommy?

382
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:19,848
I don't want to be your mommy!

383
00:26:20,088 --> 00:26:21,528
- Shut up!
- What?

384
00:26:25,568 --> 00:26:27,688
Somebody do something about that doll!

385
00:26:32,608 --> 00:26:34,809
I have a boo-boo.

386
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:44,409
This is crazy. Why does anyone
want to kill me?

387
00:26:44,889 --> 00:26:46,289
He got home first.

388
00:26:46,529 --> 00:26:49,609
You saw him, he didn't see you.
You're screwed.

389
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:53,289
He's going to live your boring life
and never be the wiser.

390
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:57,849
Your wife and kid see you two
together, they'll be killed.

391
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:42,810
Goddamn it, Wiley!

392
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,450
Son of a bitch.

393
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,891
Stupid!

394
00:28:05,171 --> 00:28:07,331
Blow out his tires this time!

395
00:28:15,651 --> 00:28:16,891
Shit!

396
00:28:56,892 --> 00:28:58,532
That was spectacular.

397
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:17,373
Son of a bitch.

398
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:20,013
Hold my belt.

399
00:29:20,733 --> 00:29:21,693
Okay.

400
00:29:25,693 --> 00:29:26,613
You got me?

401
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:30,653
Little more.

402
00:29:55,334 --> 00:29:57,534
Get some people
to look for this guy!

403
00:29:57,774 --> 00:30:00,894
Pick up Wiley and Talia's bodies
and get them to the lab.

404
00:30:18,814 --> 00:30:23,095
I'm Dr. Griffin Weir. Welcome to the
new Weir Organ Transplant Facility.

405
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,894
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.

406
00:30:28,055 --> 00:30:30,694
Doctor, protesters claim
that cloning human organs...

407
00:30:30,895 --> 00:30:32,775
...will lead to cloning whole humans.

408
00:30:33,335 --> 00:30:36,735
That's not only illegal, we're years
from the technology to do it.

409
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:39,375
A human was cloned over 10 years ago.

410
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:41,855
And we know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.

411
00:30:42,335 --> 00:30:46,495
If you recall, the Supreme Court
ordered the clone be destroyed...

412
00:30:46,695 --> 00:30:48,975
...and I think that was
the humane thing to do.

413
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,135
It led to laws against
human cloning...

414
00:30:51,335 --> 00:30:54,496
...and set back the course of
legitimate research by years.

415
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:56,735
Mr. Drucker! You gave-

416
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,176
This is Dr. Weir's night, okay?

417
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:02,215
Is it true you want to get
the 6th Day laws repealed?

418
00:31:02,456 --> 00:31:05,056
Dr. Weir is interested in medicine,
not politics.

419
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:08,976
Mr. Drucker, the protesters claim you
run RePet at a loss...

420
00:31:09,215 --> 00:31:11,295
...to soften people
up to human cloning.

421
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,575
You know, we shouldn't forget
that not long ago...

422
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,736
...there were almost no more fish
left in the ocean...

423
00:31:17,936 --> 00:31:20,896
...and half the world's population
faced the threat of hunger.

424
00:31:21,096 --> 00:31:23,496
Cloning technology turned that around.

425
00:31:23,696 --> 00:31:26,897
Extremists won't admit
they'd rather people went hungry...

426
00:31:27,216 --> 00:31:29,936
...than eat cloned fish,
so they yell about human cloning.

427
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,976
Do you think human cloning laws
should be changed?

428
00:31:33,337 --> 00:31:37,177
Suppose a 10-year-old boy is in the
hospital, dying of liver cancer.

429
00:31:37,376 --> 00:31:39,097
Thanks to Dr. Weir's work...

430
00:31:39,296 --> 00:31:40,936
...we can save that boy.

431
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,936
In the next bed lies
another 10-year-old boy...

432
00:31:44,177 --> 00:31:46,337
...whose parents love him
just as much...

433
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:49,097
...only he has
an inoperable brain tumor.

434
00:31:49,297 --> 00:31:51,616
You cannot clone a brain.

435
00:31:51,817 --> 00:31:54,777
The only way to save him
would be to clone the whole person.

436
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:59,217
How do you tell that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy...

437
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,417
...but the research that would have
saved their son wasn't done...

438
00:32:02,698 --> 00:32:06,057
...because of a law passed by
frightened politicians a decade ago?

439
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:08,217
So, what does that mean?

440
00:32:08,537 --> 00:32:09,777
Enjoy the party.

441
00:32:17,778 --> 00:32:20,778
- Looks like you needed rescuing.
- Yes, I did. Thank you.

442
00:32:21,058 --> 00:32:25,538
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

443
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:30,098
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

444
00:32:32,498 --> 00:32:33,418
Hey, boss!

445
00:32:34,298 --> 00:32:36,658
Johnny. How's my star quarterback?

446
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:41,898
I'd say I felt like a million bucks,
but I'd hate to take a pay cut.

447
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,979
Don't remind me, all right?

448
00:32:44,178 --> 00:32:46,859
That was one nasty hit you took
last week.

449
00:32:47,058 --> 00:32:49,898
Be careful. We don't want you
getting killed.

450
00:32:50,098 --> 00:32:52,739
Katherine? Are you all right?

451
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:55,258
I'm just feeling
like I don't quite belong.

452
00:32:55,859 --> 00:32:57,618
But I'm fine. Really.

453
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:59,258
No, you're not.

454
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,458
Should I call Dr. Stevens?

455
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:04,499
No, no, no.
I just overdid it, that's all.

456
00:33:05,339 --> 00:33:06,979
I'll get a car to take you home.

457
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:08,219
Thank you.

458
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:14,899
Mr. Speaker? Thank you so much
for coming. Champagne?

459
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,059
- That was quite a speech.
- You heard that?

460
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,579
Sorry I got carried away.

461
00:33:19,819 --> 00:33:22,059
Your words meant a great deal to me.

462
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:26,059
As it happens, I have a son
with an inoperable tumor of the brain.

463
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:29,660
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, sir.

464
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,739
It must have been in my subconscious,
knowing you were here.

465
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,980
No, no, it's all right.

466
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:36,660
Gave me a lot to think about.

467
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,419
It gave me a different view
of the subject.

468
00:33:40,659 --> 00:33:41,940
Mr. Speaker...

469
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,780
...could I offer you a glass of brandy
in my office upstairs?

470
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,300
I was 50 when Billy was born.

471
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,540
I didn't know if I wanted
another kid so late.

472
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,700
But now I love him so damn much.

473
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,101
If there were something
we could do for Billy...

474
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,860
...only it was highly illegal...

475
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:15,741
...would you consider it?

476
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:18,461
Of course I would.
That's the same hypothetical-

477
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:21,301
No, no. Don't answer so fast.

478
00:34:22,461 --> 00:34:26,101
You'd face a minimum sentence of
40 years if it ever came out.

479
00:34:26,501 --> 00:34:27,661
But he'd be cured?

480
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:29,501
He'd be exactly the same.

481
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,061
Perfect health.

482
00:34:31,701 --> 00:34:33,101
Never even have to know.

483
00:34:34,581 --> 00:34:36,341
But if the secret came out...

484
00:34:36,621 --> 00:34:38,181
...with the law now...

485
00:34:38,421 --> 00:34:40,621
...he'd be put to sleep
like a rabid dog.

486
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,661
He'd be destroyed,
like a horse with a broken leg.

487
00:34:43,862 --> 00:34:46,261
And if it never came out?

488
00:34:46,901 --> 00:34:49,342
Or if the laws were changed one day?

489
00:34:52,661 --> 00:34:54,741
Billy wouldn't have
anything to worry about.

490
00:35:23,862 --> 00:35:25,023
I beg you.

491
00:35:25,423 --> 00:35:28,182
Go to my house and pick up
my wife and daughter.

492
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,223
If I go there, they'll kill them both.

493
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:33,863
You made a different report
an hour ago.

494
00:35:34,102 --> 00:35:35,222
No, I didn't.

495
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,703
According to this, you did.

496
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,582
That must have been the clone.

497
00:35:41,823 --> 00:35:44,423
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

498
00:35:44,623 --> 00:35:46,623
I can hardly believe it myself.

499
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:48,983
- Was your car stolen or not?
- Yes.

500
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:51,703
- So you did report it?
- No, I took it.

501
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:53,023
You stole your own car?

502
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:56,984
I'm a court-appointed virtual
attorney. You don't have to answer.

503
00:35:57,223 --> 00:35:59,584
Is my client being charged
with auto theft?

504
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,023
I didn't steal it! It's mine!

505
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:03,303
He claims it was filed by his clone.

506
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:06,304
I see. Loading virtual psychiatrist.

507
00:36:06,824 --> 00:36:10,144
Mr. Gibson,
what seems to be the trouble?

508
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:13,224
Go through it now with him?

509
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:15,783
You're avoiding
talking about your parents.

510
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,904
Imagine: Two turtles
are walking through the desert-

511
00:36:19,184 --> 00:36:20,064
Shut up!

512
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:27,584
What?

513
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:31,664
- Are you going to help me or not?
- Of course we are.

514
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:35,224
Medical alert transmitted.
Awaiting data.

515
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:39,065
Wait in here. I'll come get you
as soon as we have news.

516
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:47,344
Clones.

517
00:37:20,346 --> 00:37:22,386
He saw himself at his house tonight.

518
00:37:22,585 --> 00:37:24,225
Which was our mistake, not his.

519
00:37:24,466 --> 00:37:25,745
Excuse me.

520
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,345
He's at precinct seven.

521
00:37:28,665 --> 00:37:31,385
Can you hurry Talia and Wiley along?
I'll need them both.

522
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,347
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

523
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,668
Piece of shit Wiley.
I'm gonna kill him. Where is he?

524
00:38:58,308 --> 00:39:00,028
He's still cooking.

525
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:02,028
Son of a bitch.

526
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,668
I look like crap.

527
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:14,349
Do you have any idea how much
my hair treatments cost?

528
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:16,109
How much does Gibson know?

529
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:19,989
That he's been cloned and we'll
kill anyone who sees them together.

530
00:39:20,229 --> 00:39:22,108
What's that? What?

531
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:26,468
Does Drucker know you're talking
about killing innocent people?

532
00:39:27,028 --> 00:39:28,388
Relax. It's just a threat.

533
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:30,589
Of course, we'd never actually do it.

534
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:33,909
Try to have a good night.

535
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:37,149
You do your hair.
I'll take Wiley and Vincent.

536
00:39:37,469 --> 00:39:39,869
I've got to pierce my damn ears again.

537
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:46,029
Officials blame the latest strike
by major league players...

538
00:39:46,229 --> 00:39:48,389
...entering its 4th year
and a lack...

539
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,789
...of fan identification with teams
in the Series for the dismal ratings.

540
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,630
Shit.

541
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,470
Oh, no.

542
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,631
Now what?

543
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,990
It feels tight all across here...

544
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:29,391
...where the tires ran over me.

545
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,590
You were run over by two cars
and your chest was crushed.

546
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,391
Exactly. I mean, no wonder, right?

547
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,710
It's in your mind.

548
00:40:36,911 --> 00:40:38,870
Completely crushed.

549
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:40,390
As in dead.

550
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,110
As in you have
a totally new chest now.

551
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,550
Then why is it hard to breathe?

552
00:40:47,951 --> 00:40:49,231
Tell you what.

553
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:51,671
Why don't you just stay out here?
Relax.

554
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:53,871
The fresh air will do you good.

555
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:57,591
State and government officials
in Washington, D.C...

556
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,631
...are openly dismissive
of the Microsoft proposal.

557
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:05,511
This amounts to an attempt by
Microsoft to buy a state of the Union.

558
00:41:05,751 --> 00:41:08,111
Nothing in our Constitution
or history...

559
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,952
...offers the remotest legal theory...

560
00:41:11,151 --> 00:41:14,112
...by which a corporation can,
in effect, own a state.

561
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:26,312
But if he goes off his medication,
the paranoid delusions come back.

562
00:41:31,712 --> 00:41:36,392
Very sad. Because at other times,
he seems almost rational.

563
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:39,152
Gibson!

564
00:41:40,112 --> 00:41:41,152
Gibson!

565
00:42:18,913 --> 00:42:20,233
- You're dead.
- No.

566
00:42:21,953 --> 00:42:23,073
You're dead.

567
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:34,633
Try to stay dead this time.

568
00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:44,314
Hank, it's me again.

569
00:42:44,513 --> 00:42:46,114
What happened to you?

570
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:49,154
I waited for half an hour at Kelly's.

571
00:42:49,354 --> 00:42:50,794
It's now five past 7.

572
00:42:50,994 --> 00:42:52,594
I'm heading home, okay?

573
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:00,434
He's fine. He's okay.
He's our associate.

574
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,554
Gibson must have knocked him out.

575
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:05,274
Knocked him out?
He looks dead to me, doc.

576
00:43:07,275 --> 00:43:09,315
No. Pulse is strong.

577
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:13,795
He'll be up and around in no time.
We'll get him to the hospital.

578
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:15,274
Easy.

579
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,474
Let us know if you find Gibson.

580
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:24,955
Honey, I'm home.

581
00:43:27,075 --> 00:43:28,674
Darling, where are you?

582
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:29,955
Hi, sugar.

583
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,275
Hello, my love.

584
00:43:31,515 --> 00:43:33,275
Have you been working out?

585
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,755
- You look so good.
- Thank you.

586
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:40,795
I recorded your sports programs.

587
00:43:40,996 --> 00:43:42,995
Maybe we can watch them together.

588
00:43:43,275 --> 00:43:44,395
I'd like that.

589
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:46,756
Or should I just take this off now?

590
00:43:47,556 --> 00:43:49,076
No. Hold your horses.

591
00:43:56,036 --> 00:44:00,036
Oh, Hank, I think it's so sexy
when you go right to the chair.

592
00:44:00,235 --> 00:44:01,236
I know you do.

593
00:44:06,916 --> 00:44:09,636
You're gonna have to
zip me up, sweetheart.

594
00:44:12,036 --> 00:44:13,396
Careful with the merchandise.

595
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,597
Hold on, please!

596
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:23,436
- Have they been here?
- Who?

597
00:44:24,156 --> 00:44:25,876
Hello, Adam. Would you like a beer?

598
00:44:28,597 --> 00:44:30,917
I'm sorry I missed the party, but...

599
00:44:31,276 --> 00:44:35,317
...all of a sudden it's 11:00
and I wound up at Kelly's.

600
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:38,077
- You missed my party?
- Not on purpose.

601
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:42,437
It was sort of weird. I feel
terrible. I don't know what happened.

602
00:44:42,677 --> 00:44:46,557
You feel terrible? I lost my wife,
my daughter and my life tonight.

603
00:44:46,757 --> 00:44:47,757
special dance.

604
00:44:47,957 --> 00:44:49,117
Hank, listen.

605
00:44:49,357 --> 00:44:50,357
I need your help.

606
00:44:51,597 --> 00:44:53,077
Not now, cupcake!

607
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,157
What going on? I don't understand.

608
00:44:58,397 --> 00:44:59,598
That's a real gun.

609
00:45:01,078 --> 00:45:02,598
What, what's going-?

610
00:45:13,958 --> 00:45:16,398
Jesus! What are you gonna do?
Kill my cat?

611
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:18,758
What the hell is going on?

612
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:22,318
If you weren't at my party,
then you didn't see him.

613
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:23,838
Who's " him"?

614
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:44,879
Jesus H. Christ. I said
get your dog cloned, not yourself.

615
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:47,118
What are you going to do?

616
00:45:47,439 --> 00:45:49,038
Take my life back.

617
00:45:49,318 --> 00:45:50,639
You're going to kill him?

618
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:53,958
Why not? He's not real.
Plus, there's no law against it.

619
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:55,598
You're not serious.

620
00:45:55,799 --> 00:45:57,079
I'm dead serious.

621
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:01,599
But look at him.
He looks just like you.

622
00:46:01,799 --> 00:46:04,479
Technically, this could be
committing suicide.

623
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:06,639
But he's not me.

624
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,239
He's not even human.

625
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:12,519
Wait a second. How do I know
he's not you and you're not him?

626
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,359
Look at him.
He's even a shitty carpenter.

627
00:46:16,839 --> 00:46:18,639
- Let me see your chin.
- My chin?

628
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:20,999
- You cut yourself shaving.
- Here.

629
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,160
Okay, it's there. You're you.

630
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,680
I couldn't do it.

631
00:46:57,681 --> 00:46:58,600
Over here.

632
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,801
I have a little something for you.

633
00:47:05,121 --> 00:47:06,961
- Is Clara asleep?
- Yes, she is.

634
00:47:15,761 --> 00:47:17,161
He's grabbing her ass.

635
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,481
I like how cigars make you feel.

636
00:47:20,801 --> 00:47:21,841
Daddy?

637
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:35,641
What are you doing out here?

638
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:37,722
I had a bad dream.

639
00:47:39,601 --> 00:47:42,041
I'll take you back to bed. Come on.

640
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,602
- Fireman.
- Fireman, right.

641
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:47,162
Wait here.

642
00:47:51,522 --> 00:47:52,802
Cigar, sir?

643
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:55,482
I can't wait.

644
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:03,402
- How do you like it?
- This is so good.

645
00:48:03,602 --> 00:48:04,602
Want to try some?

646
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:08,362
No. Smoking's illegal,
and I'm a mother- All right.

647
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:17,683
Sweetheart, I'm sorry about the RePet.

648
00:48:18,883 --> 00:48:20,482
It's all right.

649
00:48:20,923 --> 00:48:21,923
Dad?

650
00:48:22,283 --> 00:48:23,843
Did Oliver die?

651
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:25,682
Is he a RePet?

652
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:27,763
Why do you say that?

653
00:48:28,002 --> 00:48:29,603
You locked him outside.

654
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:32,483
I did? Oh, I'm so sorry.

655
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:35,043
I haven't been myself lately.

656
00:48:47,564 --> 00:48:50,083
All right. You go to sleep now.

657
00:48:50,403 --> 00:48:51,684
Close your eyes.

658
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:56,604
When was the last time we did it
in the back of the car?

659
00:48:57,324 --> 00:48:59,644
We should smoke cigars more often.

660
00:49:13,484 --> 00:49:14,604
Mr. Gibson?

661
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:17,404
- Who are you?
- Millennium Security. Sorry to-

662
00:49:17,604 --> 00:49:19,244
You got any I.D.?

663
00:49:19,484 --> 00:49:20,404
Of course.

664
00:49:23,404 --> 00:49:26,604
Sorry I was a little jumpy
but we had a break-in earlier.

665
00:49:26,805 --> 00:49:27,924
We know.

666
00:49:28,284 --> 00:49:30,085
Your car was found in the river.

667
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:32,525
They find the bastard that stole it?

668
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:35,725
Relax. He's a friend of mine.

669
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:38,084
Sorry about this.

670
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:40,045
Nice 'do.

671
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:42,925
He's here to help me fix the garage.

672
00:49:43,245 --> 00:49:44,244
Heel!

673
00:49:44,845 --> 00:49:46,125
Now what?

674
00:49:46,645 --> 00:49:47,804
Go see.

675
00:49:48,045 --> 00:49:49,445
Sorry, but he's a RePet.

676
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:54,405
He was a good watchdog. Now he lets
my car get stolen and barks.

677
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:55,765
I hate clones.

678
00:49:58,885 --> 00:50:01,045
Well, we'll keep an eye
on your property.

679
00:50:04,045 --> 00:50:06,405
I'll sleep better
knowing you're around.

680
00:50:06,605 --> 00:50:07,845
Try to have a good night.

681
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:10,085
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

682
00:50:16,406 --> 00:50:17,485
Hide.

683
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:24,526
Stop it, Oliver.

684
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:30,325
Stop it.

685
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:37,966
Gee, you're glitchy today. Come on.

686
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:53,006
Good Oliver. That was a bad idea.

687
00:50:54,766 --> 00:50:58,886
- Let's get out of here.
- We can't leave them with that thing.

688
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,807
Those were the guys trying to kill me.

689
00:51:06,006 --> 00:51:09,047
It's dangerous for Natalie and Clara
if I hang around.

690
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,248
Darling, you're still awake.

691
00:51:20,727 --> 00:51:23,407
I wanted to wait up for you.

692
00:51:23,887 --> 00:51:24,847
Thank you.

693
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:27,727
And I wanted to spend time
with these flowers.

694
00:51:28,007 --> 00:51:30,407
It took me 17 generations
to get this right.

695
00:51:30,607 --> 00:51:32,647
If you had told me, I could have-

696
00:51:32,848 --> 00:51:35,848
I know. Engineered it
in half an hour.

697
00:51:37,488 --> 00:51:40,248
I'm not in that much of a hurry,
Griffin.

698
00:51:42,288 --> 00:51:44,407
Want to get a cup of tea,
then go upstairs?

699
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,328
Yeah.

700
00:51:47,088 --> 00:51:49,208
That's a good idea. Let's do that.

701
00:51:57,808 --> 00:51:59,288
It's okay.

702
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,048
Stay calm.

703
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,008
Stay very, very calm.

704
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:07,249
What a night.

705
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:09,808
That was the longest night in my life.

706
00:52:13,608 --> 00:52:15,249
Hello, Adam.

707
00:52:15,449 --> 00:52:17,569
I'm a one-man Virtual Girl...

708
00:52:17,769 --> 00:52:20,249
...but if you insert
the installation disk...

709
00:52:21,129 --> 00:52:22,689
- What was that?
- Nothing.

710
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,929
I felt fingers going for my zipper.
That's disgusting.

711
00:52:26,129 --> 00:52:30,489
That's disgusting? I had to look away
when you and Natalie were-

712
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:33,329
The... You want a beer?

713
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:37,409
You saw the clone do something
with Natalie.

714
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:38,970
They did nothing.

715
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:42,969
- That's not what I would have done.
- What would you have done?

716
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:44,529
I would have...

717
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:47,929
Nothing.

718
00:52:48,209 --> 00:52:51,410
Well, that's what they did.
You know... nothing.

719
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:54,089
Shit. In the goddamn minivan.

720
00:52:54,369 --> 00:52:55,449
In the minivan.

721
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,609
You know what tobacco does to people.

722
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:00,210
He smoked my stogie too?

723
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:01,930
The bastard.

724
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:03,730
That son of a bitch.

725
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,650
Son of a bitch smoked your stogie.

726
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,810
She couldn't tell it wasn't me?

727
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,850
It didn't look like it.
I mean, she seemed...

728
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:14,290
...happy.

729
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:18,130
You have no idea what it felt like
seeing her with him.

730
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,930
I should have just killed him.

731
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:24,091
It could have been worse.
At least she's not cheating on you.

732
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:28,930
Don't move!

733
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:32,531
Tripp!

734
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:34,290
I'm not after you.

735
00:53:35,051 --> 00:53:36,371
Back away.

736
00:53:39,251 --> 00:53:40,651
Back away.

737
00:53:41,491 --> 00:53:42,770
Why did you do that?

738
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:46,651
Don't do anything stupid, now.
That's as far as you go.

739
00:53:48,531 --> 00:53:49,771
Is that you, Hank?

740
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:20,292
Hank!

741
00:54:24,372 --> 00:54:26,092
Hey, Adam.

742
00:54:26,332 --> 00:54:29,332
Is Hank sleeping on the floor again?

743
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:31,772
That's so cute.

744
00:54:56,813 --> 00:55:00,213
On the sixth day, God created man.
On the sixth day...

745
00:55:01,413 --> 00:55:05,333
On the sixth day, God created man.
God created man on the sixth day.

746
00:55:06,893 --> 00:55:08,533
Why did you kill my friend?

747
00:55:09,293 --> 00:55:12,293
Hank Morgan was an abomination to God.

748
00:55:13,414 --> 00:55:14,494
He was a clone.

749
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:16,014
He was no clone.

750
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:18,214
The real Hank Morgan died
this afternoon.

751
00:55:19,613 --> 00:55:20,893
I killed him.

752
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:22,533
So I could...

753
00:55:22,734 --> 00:55:24,374
...so I could kill Drucker.

754
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:27,494
Drucker isn't dead.
It would be all over the news.

755
00:55:27,733 --> 00:55:29,414
Open your eyes.

756
00:55:29,614 --> 00:55:30,733
Drucker's a clone.

757
00:55:31,054 --> 00:55:35,533
Dr. Weir cloned Drucker.
Dr. Weir cloned your friend.

758
00:55:36,694 --> 00:55:38,014
Dr. Weir cloned you.

759
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,414
They found us.

760
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:47,974
Shoot me in the head.

761
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:50,214
- What-
- We have people at Weir's lab!

762
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:53,335
I know who they are.
They scan my brain, they'll be killed.

763
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:57,134
Shoot me.

764
00:55:57,374 --> 00:55:58,375
God forgive me.

765
00:57:20,096 --> 00:57:22,217
Doesn't anyone stay dead anymore?

766
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:25,416
Who are you people?

767
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:31,097
I.D. required.

768
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,817
Use biometric reader...

769
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,977
...to verify identification...

770
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:39,897
...or the alarm will sound
in 10 seconds. Ten...

771
00:57:40,257 --> 00:57:41,577
- He shot my foot!
- ... nine...

772
00:57:42,097 --> 00:57:43,697
...eight... seven...

773
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:46,057
- ... six... five...
- Son of a bitch!

774
00:57:46,537 --> 00:57:48,538
...four... three...

775
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:50,297
...two... one.

776
00:57:50,537 --> 00:57:51,538
Stand by.

777
00:57:54,578 --> 00:57:56,177
Systems accessed.

778
00:57:56,697 --> 00:57:57,937
Gibson!

779
00:57:58,497 --> 00:57:59,738
Select destination.

780
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:08,057
You're gonna pay!

781
00:58:08,578 --> 00:58:10,458
Those were brand-new boots!

782
00:59:17,459 --> 00:59:19,980
Dad? You're coming
to my recital, right?

783
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:22,700
Of course. I never miss
your recitals.

784
00:59:22,939 --> 00:59:24,260
I love you.

785
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,700
You're the greatest, Dad.

786
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,300
Unless her pseudomonas infection
clears up...

787
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,140
...I'm afraid there's
nothing we can do.

788
00:59:42,141 --> 00:59:44,100
What about her DNA scan?

789
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,300
Came up with cystic fibrosis.

790
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,460
Cystic fibrosis?

791
00:59:48,701 --> 00:59:51,940
Which is impossible, considering
it's a childhood disease...

792
00:59:52,141 --> 00:59:54,421
...and she would have been dead
30 years ago.

793
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,661
We're running the scan again.

794
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,500
No, I'll do it at the clinic.
If you could give us a moment, please.

795
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:04,621
Darling. Sweetheart.

796
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,821
We're having you transferred
to my clinic.

797
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:10,781
No. I'd like to stay here.

798
01:00:11,501 --> 01:00:15,541
I can help you at the clinic. If you
stay here, there's nothing I can do.

799
01:00:15,781 --> 01:00:17,901
I know, dear. I'll die.

800
01:00:18,141 --> 01:00:19,381
Yes.

801
01:00:19,661 --> 01:00:20,942
Katherine, please.

802
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:22,302
Listen to me.

803
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:24,741
Katherine died 5 years ago.

804
01:00:25,901 --> 01:00:29,901
The feelings I have aren't mine.
They're hers.

805
01:00:34,861 --> 01:00:36,782
Katherine, listen.

806
01:00:38,422 --> 01:00:39,822
Don't do this.

807
01:00:40,342 --> 01:00:43,342
I need you so much. I need you.

808
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:46,862
I'm not afraid, Griffin.

809
01:00:47,822 --> 01:00:49,622
I want to die.

810
01:00:50,062 --> 01:00:52,462
My time has already passed.

811
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:54,742
My love.

812
01:00:57,102 --> 01:00:59,462
What am I to do without you?

813
01:00:59,662 --> 01:01:00,622
What?

814
01:01:03,382 --> 01:01:05,623
You just water my flowers...

815
01:01:06,382 --> 01:01:07,662
...okay?

816
01:01:12,663 --> 01:01:17,103
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

817
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,623
Weir Clinic, stay away!
No research on DNA!

818
01:01:21,903 --> 01:01:24,062
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.

819
01:01:24,303 --> 01:01:25,903
We're in the business of life.

820
01:01:27,103 --> 01:01:30,143
Welcome to the new home of the
Weir Organ Transplant Facility...

821
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:32,663
...here at Replacement Technologies.

822
01:01:44,943 --> 01:01:46,904
Excuse me, sir.
I've got to check that.

823
01:01:48,623 --> 01:01:50,664
Sure. Help yourself.

824
01:01:52,343 --> 01:01:53,303
But...

825
01:01:53,504 --> 01:01:55,024
...you might want to use these.

826
01:01:55,223 --> 01:01:56,183
What's in here?

827
01:01:56,384 --> 01:01:58,664
Lower intestines for Dr. Weir.

828
01:01:58,864 --> 01:02:01,144
He's doing a study
on the flesh-eating virus.

829
01:02:01,424 --> 01:02:02,864
You can open it.

830
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:05,464
Just try not to breathe.

831
01:02:08,384 --> 01:02:09,904
That's okay.

832
01:02:10,104 --> 01:02:11,144
You're cleared.

833
01:02:11,384 --> 01:02:12,664
Thanks.

834
01:02:22,544 --> 01:02:24,744
What about her DNA scan?

835
01:02:25,144 --> 01:02:26,904
Came up with cystic fibrosis.

836
01:02:27,105 --> 01:02:29,944
Which is impossible considering
it's a childhood disease-

837
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:31,304
dead 30 years ago.

838
01:02:34,704 --> 01:02:36,305
So we're running a new scan.

839
01:02:37,225 --> 01:02:39,145
No, I'll do it at the clinic.

840
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:45,505
We've had 5 extra years
since you cloned me.

841
01:02:46,105 --> 01:02:47,545
I treasure that.

842
01:02:47,785 --> 01:02:49,025
- Katherine, please.
- No.

843
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:50,385
Please.

844
01:02:50,705 --> 01:02:52,545
I'm not afraid.

845
01:02:53,305 --> 01:02:54,905
I want to die.

846
01:02:55,745 --> 01:02:58,146
My time has already passed.

847
01:04:02,987 --> 01:04:04,307
Can I help you?

848
01:04:06,507 --> 01:04:09,267
No. I just dropped my pen.

849
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:13,148
I'm all thumbs today.

850
01:04:17,668 --> 01:04:18,908
Thank you.

851
01:04:29,787 --> 01:04:32,188
Will you cut that out?
It's driving me crazy.

852
01:04:32,508 --> 01:04:35,708
Excuse me, but I nearly had my head
ripped off and it hurts.

853
01:04:36,507 --> 01:04:39,348
It's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.

854
01:04:39,548 --> 01:04:40,828
You'd know better about that?

855
01:04:41,148 --> 01:04:42,228
Yes, he would.

856
01:04:42,468 --> 01:04:45,788
It was your old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?

857
01:04:46,468 --> 01:04:50,268
- I got killed twice in two hours.
- Knock it off. We've all been killed.

858
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:52,949
You know what really bothers me?

859
01:04:53,148 --> 01:04:55,228
That I've never even seen
a white light.

860
01:04:55,508 --> 01:04:56,988
Never seen angels. Nothing.

861
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,549
Give me a break.

862
01:05:04,908 --> 01:05:06,229
I have you logged in.

863
01:05:06,589 --> 01:05:08,429
What? When?

864
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:11,908
Twenty minutes ago.
You've entered a restricted area.

865
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:13,869
Son of a bitch has got my thumb.

866
01:05:14,109 --> 01:05:16,389
Deactivate Talia,
put out a security alert...

867
01:05:16,589 --> 01:05:18,909
...and seal off Drucker's office, now!
Let's go!

868
01:05:35,509 --> 01:05:36,830
Shit.

869
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:38,710
Can I help you?

870
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:39,870
Yeah.

871
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:42,190
You can stick your thumb on that.

872
01:06:09,150 --> 01:06:11,870
- Thank God.
- What? More fundamentalists?

873
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,630
No. Adam Gibson.
We think he's in the building.

874
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:16,830
Why wasn't he taken care of already?

875
01:06:23,751 --> 01:06:25,911
There are four of you and one of him!

876
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:28,310
Two of him, but you see what I mean.

877
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:32,351
He has a wife and kid, right?
Get them. We may need the leverage.

878
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,031
It costs me $1.2 million
each time I clone you people.

879
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:37,951
Try to be worth the money.

880
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,992
They'll kill you for seeing this.

881
01:07:03,711 --> 01:07:06,912
They're doing their best already.
Where's Dr. Weir?

882
01:07:08,752 --> 01:07:10,312
His lab's over there.

883
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:18,032
Dr. Weir.

884
01:07:19,792 --> 01:07:22,432
I know about the intruder.
Your office called.

885
01:07:22,632 --> 01:07:24,472
Everything's under control.

886
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:28,832
It's not under control.

887
01:07:31,073 --> 01:07:32,833
You had me cloned.

888
01:07:35,033 --> 01:07:36,033
Yes.

889
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:38,193
Well, you cloned the wrong man.

890
01:07:38,913 --> 01:07:42,273
How did you do it? You had
to have my- What do you call it?

891
01:07:42,473 --> 01:07:44,152
Your syncording. We had it.

892
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,353
Give it to me.

893
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:46,673
I want my life back.

894
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:00,994
Here. It's your syncording.

895
01:08:02,313 --> 01:08:03,713
How did you get this?

896
01:08:04,673 --> 01:08:06,793
- I haven't been-
- Here.

897
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,474
The vision test.

898
01:08:12,674 --> 01:08:15,033
It didn't test vision.
It took your syncording.

899
01:08:15,234 --> 01:08:17,073
An exact picture of your mind.

900
01:08:17,314 --> 01:08:21,873
And it took sample of DNA. With those
we can clone a person in 2 hours.

901
01:08:22,114 --> 01:08:25,954
We had you so we could act quickly
when we were told you were killed.

902
01:08:26,634 --> 01:08:28,194
Told I was killed?

903
01:08:52,955 --> 01:08:54,915
Please don't drink and drive.

904
01:08:56,194 --> 01:08:57,795
Gibson family schedule.

905
01:08:58,035 --> 01:08:59,955
Clara's recital at school.

906
01:09:03,995 --> 01:09:06,075
This is Michael Drucker's.

907
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,635
A syncording contains everything
in a person's memory...

908
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:13,075
...and this is what Drucker saw
and heard just before he died.

909
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:16,436
You don't become a rich man
without making enemies...

910
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,555
...so we back up his mind religiously.

911
01:09:27,035 --> 01:09:29,556
- You own the Roadrunners, right?
- Among other things.

912
01:09:29,756 --> 01:09:32,356
- You a fan?
- I'm a fan of both those teams.

913
01:09:32,555 --> 01:09:34,276
I'll have to get you some tickets.

914
01:09:34,516 --> 01:09:37,436
- Promise, right?
- Sure. I'll do it right now.

915
01:09:37,636 --> 01:09:40,755
Sally, remind me to get
Roadrunner tickets for Adam Gibson.

916
01:09:40,956 --> 01:09:42,236
He's my pilot today.

917
01:09:43,355 --> 01:09:45,756
On the sixth day, God created man.

918
01:09:46,396 --> 01:09:49,956
I'm about to get on my snowboard-
Hey, he's got a gun!

919
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,596
Shit. It's a fundamentalist.

920
01:09:53,796 --> 01:09:56,556
He just shot them both.
Call Marshall. You hear me?

921
01:09:56,757 --> 01:09:57,956
Sally? Oh, shit.

922
01:09:58,196 --> 01:10:00,037
No, you don't have to- Sally!

923
01:10:00,236 --> 01:10:01,236
Help!

924
01:10:02,397 --> 01:10:05,876
An anti-cloning fundamentalist
killed everyone on board.

925
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:08,316
It should have been me.

926
01:10:08,517 --> 01:10:11,236
We thought it was you.
Drucker even mentioned your name.

927
01:10:11,476 --> 01:10:14,397
So, we used your DNA and syncording
to clone you.

928
01:10:14,597 --> 01:10:16,637
To resurrect him,
we had to cover it up.

929
01:10:16,836 --> 01:10:17,877
Keep talking.

930
01:10:18,077 --> 01:10:21,797
We cloned everyone. We realized
you switched places too late.

931
01:10:21,997 --> 01:10:24,157
Access denied. Invalid thumbprint.

932
01:10:24,397 --> 01:10:26,717
- They're trying to kill me.
- There are two Adam Gibsons.

933
01:10:26,917 --> 01:10:29,037
That's proof humans
are being cloned...

934
01:10:29,237 --> 01:10:31,637
...which makes you very dangerous
to Drucker.

935
01:10:31,837 --> 01:10:34,397
- Accessing security.
- Tell me why I'm a threat.

936
01:10:34,597 --> 01:10:37,518
Drucker was killed 3 years ago.
We cloned him then...

937
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:39,797
- ... and we cloned him yesterday.
- So?

938
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:42,517
If that came out, he'd be
destroyed in every way.

939
01:10:43,357 --> 01:10:46,438
A clone has no rights.
A clone can't own anything.

940
01:10:46,637 --> 01:10:48,117
Drucker would lose all this...

941
01:10:48,318 --> 01:10:50,358
...because Drucker would be...

942
01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:51,478
...legally dead.

943
01:10:52,757 --> 01:10:55,158
Look at all the cameras
you got in this place.

944
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,718
You can't find one guy?

945
01:10:58,158 --> 01:10:59,318
There. There.

946
01:10:59,518 --> 01:11:02,398
We don't need where he's been.
We need to find where he is.

947
01:11:09,238 --> 01:11:10,518
Let's go. Hit the alarm.

948
01:11:10,718 --> 01:11:12,598
- What's up?
- What area's so sensitive...

949
01:11:12,798 --> 01:11:14,198
...we don't allow cameras?

950
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:15,878
Drucker will do anything-

951
01:11:16,078 --> 01:11:18,519
Anything to destroy the evidence.

952
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:20,959
And you're the evidence.

953
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:24,399
This is evidence too.

954
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:26,358
Move! Clear the way!

955
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:28,278
Let's go.

956
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:45,119
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay, Clara.

957
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:47,200
Anyone else need to go?

958
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:01,199
Why do you think I'm telling you?
Because I can do nothing to stop them.

959
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,600
- There he is!
- Zone Six. Engineering.

960
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:05,759
Move! Clear the way!

961
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,079
Or what they'll do to your family.

962
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,360
My family?

963
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:13,800
Drucker has to kill one of you. If he
can't kill you, he'll kill the other.

964
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,120
They could get killed in the process.

965
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:18,479
Get out!

966
01:12:18,680 --> 01:12:20,800
Destination "Get out" not understood.

967
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,240
Morgan Randall Elementary School!

968
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,481
I'm very sorry, sir.

969
01:12:59,481 --> 01:13:00,481
Daddy!

970
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:03,602
She's supposed
to be up there now, right?

971
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:05,881
This is the...

972
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:07,162
That's odd.

973
01:13:08,522 --> 01:13:11,282
I'm gonna go check
and make sure everything's okay.

974
01:13:12,362 --> 01:13:13,481
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

975
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:17,162
Clara?

976
01:13:23,641 --> 01:13:24,962
Oh, my God.

977
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:26,401
Mommy!

978
01:13:27,081 --> 01:13:28,282
Mommy, I'm scared.

979
01:13:28,482 --> 01:13:30,402
I'm here. I got you.

980
01:13:33,562 --> 01:13:34,522
Could you help us?

981
01:13:37,442 --> 01:13:38,402
What are you doing?

982
01:13:38,602 --> 01:13:40,602
This is the only thing
keeping the dogs...

983
01:13:40,802 --> 01:13:42,442
...from tearing her apart.

984
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:44,802
So be quiet and come with us.

985
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:01,323
Let's go!

986
01:14:02,283 --> 01:14:03,883
- Daddy!
- Adam!

987
01:14:09,963 --> 01:14:10,923
Natalie!

988
01:14:33,923 --> 01:14:36,083
You have reached 911 emergency.

989
01:14:36,324 --> 01:14:38,403
- Your call is important to us.
- I know.

990
01:14:38,604 --> 01:14:40,043
Your "yes" or "no" answers...

991
01:14:40,284 --> 01:14:43,404
...will help us in directing
police services to assist you.

992
01:14:43,603 --> 01:14:45,523
- Are you reporting a felony?
- Yes.

993
01:14:45,724 --> 01:14:48,683
- Thank you for reporting a felony.
- Come on.

994
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,684
Is the felony in progress now?

995
01:14:50,883 --> 01:14:51,844
Yes!

996
01:14:52,044 --> 01:14:53,564
Thank you.

997
01:14:53,764 --> 01:14:56,284
Is there a danger of bodily harm
to you or others?

998
01:14:56,484 --> 01:14:57,484
Yes!

999
01:14:57,684 --> 01:14:59,924
Are suspects or injured victims...

1000
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:03,324
Forget about talking to the police.
I tried that already.

1001
01:15:03,524 --> 01:15:06,004
Who the hell are you?

1002
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:08,764
I know this sounds insane, but...

1003
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,924
...I'm Adam Gibson.

1004
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:15,564
We don't have time for you to be
shocked. They have Natalie and Clara.

1005
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:18,645
- I need your help to get my family.
- They're my family.

1006
01:15:22,765 --> 01:15:24,245
That's for sleeping with my wife...

1007
01:15:25,965 --> 01:15:27,364
...in the damn minivan.

1008
01:15:29,045 --> 01:15:31,805
Your report has been canceled
at your request.

1009
01:15:32,165 --> 01:15:34,485
Thanks for visiting
Replacement Technologies.

1010
01:15:36,485 --> 01:15:37,765
It's him.

1011
01:15:38,445 --> 01:15:40,765
I believe you have something of mine.

1012
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:43,965
No, I have everything of yours.

1013
01:15:44,165 --> 01:15:46,725
I have the syncording
that proves you're a clone.

1014
01:15:46,925 --> 01:15:48,405
I have everything of yours:

1015
01:15:48,606 --> 01:15:50,965
Your family in the palm of my hand.

1016
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:53,285
- Shall we trade?
- You read my mind.

1017
01:15:53,806 --> 01:15:54,925
Just the highlights.

1018
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:58,006
All right. I'll bring the disk...

1019
01:15:58,245 --> 01:16:01,286
...to the Double X Charter office
at 10:00 tonight.

1020
01:16:01,486 --> 01:16:03,165
Be there with my family.

1021
01:16:11,806 --> 01:16:13,766
Did you have to hit me that hard?

1022
01:16:13,966 --> 01:16:16,366
I had to stop you
from talking to the police.

1023
01:16:16,566 --> 01:16:18,246
That's a good one.

1024
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:20,526
That should do it.

1025
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:23,686
What are you doing?

1026
01:16:23,886 --> 01:16:26,766
Testing it. I don't think
you have enough aluminum.

1027
01:16:27,247 --> 01:16:30,926
Are you kidding? That's the same
amount I used in the Rain Forest War.

1028
01:16:32,207 --> 01:16:33,886
You shouldn't be talking.

1029
01:16:34,087 --> 01:16:36,447
The mess you left
trying to fix your garage...

1030
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:39,287
- You saw me working in the garage?
- Saw you?

1031
01:16:39,487 --> 01:16:41,007
I nearly shot you.

1032
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:46,927
Let's try it.

1033
01:17:04,728 --> 01:17:06,368
- Cool.
- Cool.

1034
01:17:09,967 --> 01:17:12,248
You better be miles away
when this goes off.

1035
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:15,727
I'm worried about getting inside
to find Natalie and Clara.

1036
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:18,607
I'll take my chances getting out.

1037
01:17:21,408 --> 01:17:22,328
Griffin.

1038
01:17:22,528 --> 01:17:23,608
Here.

1039
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:27,088
- What are you doing?
- Yours. Yours.

1040
01:17:27,808 --> 01:17:29,568
Griffin, what's the matter?

1041
01:17:30,328 --> 01:17:31,848
My wife, Katherine, is dead.

1042
01:17:32,048 --> 01:17:34,089
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1043
01:17:35,608 --> 01:17:37,528
Griffin, I don't know-

1044
01:17:37,728 --> 01:17:38,889
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,769
Don't start with "sorry" with me.
Don't start!

1046
01:17:41,968 --> 01:17:44,369
Don't start with "sorry"!

1047
01:17:45,049 --> 01:17:47,968
I know about the congenital defects
you've been imbedding...

1048
01:17:48,169 --> 01:17:49,488
...into the clone DNA.

1049
01:17:49,689 --> 01:17:52,689
There's my wife, Johnny Phoenix
and the others.

1050
01:17:53,249 --> 01:17:55,449
But, Michael, why my wife? Why?

1051
01:17:55,648 --> 01:17:57,168
You're right, Griffin.

1052
01:17:59,729 --> 01:18:03,289
It's a security protocol I implemented.
I knew you wouldn't understand.

1053
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:05,249
What should I understand?

1054
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:07,529
The only thing I understand is that...

1055
01:18:08,129 --> 01:18:10,009
...you gave my wife cystic fibrosis!

1056
01:18:10,249 --> 01:18:11,289
Calm down.

1057
01:18:11,889 --> 01:18:14,569
Someone made a mistake.
This wasn't meant to hurt her.

1058
01:18:14,769 --> 01:18:16,489
It didn't hurt her. It killed her.

1059
01:18:16,689 --> 01:18:20,010
Suppose we clone a senator who
agrees to support us, then doesn't.

1060
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:24,329
Or Johnny Phoenix wants more money.
Shorter life spans gives us leverage.

1061
01:18:24,530 --> 01:18:25,770
What's the point?

1062
01:18:25,969 --> 01:18:29,050
The point is, if they betray us
they're dead.

1063
01:18:29,289 --> 01:18:31,889
If they stay on the team,
we clone them again.

1064
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:35,530
Exactly what we'll do with Katherine.
I'm sure she's being cloned now.

1065
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:36,690
No, she's not.

1066
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:39,170
- No.
- She's-

1067
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,130
Griffin, it was a mistake.

1068
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:46,010
If you're concerned about her DNA,
go through it yourself.

1069
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,490
Obviously there's no charge
for the cloning.

1070
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:51,410
No charge. Thank you very much.

1071
01:18:51,610 --> 01:18:54,530
What you don't understand
is, she doesn't want to be cloned.

1072
01:18:54,731 --> 01:18:56,450
So, do it anyway.

1073
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,930
Do it anyway. I see.

1074
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:02,251
Let me explain something to you.

1075
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:05,770
I loved my wife very much.

1076
01:19:05,971 --> 01:19:08,691
So much so, I promised
I'd never bring her back again.

1077
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:10,611
And I won't.

1078
01:19:11,611 --> 01:19:15,011
And if I can't bring her back,
I'll never bring back anyone, ever.

1079
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:18,331
That's how much I loved her.

1080
01:19:21,011 --> 01:19:22,731
So, it's over, it's finished...

1081
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:24,411
...and I quit.

1082
01:19:25,851 --> 01:19:28,011
Well, I can't let you quit.

1083
01:19:28,251 --> 01:19:30,412
I've looked the other way too often.

1084
01:19:30,611 --> 01:19:32,851
I've justified too much, so...

1085
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,132
...I'm finished. It's over.

1086
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:47,652
- Know what I'm going to do for you?
- What are you going to do for me?

1087
01:19:48,531 --> 01:19:49,812
I'm going to give you...

1088
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,732
...the greatest gift you can imagine.

1089
01:19:53,172 --> 01:19:55,092
- A gift?
- I'm gonna save your life.

1090
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:59,252
I'm gonna save Katherine's life.
I'm gonna save our friendship.

1091
01:19:59,452 --> 01:20:01,372
And I'm gonna save your marriage.

1092
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:04,132
What are you talking about?

1093
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:08,852
I'm gonna kill you now...

1094
01:20:09,052 --> 01:20:12,252
...and I'm going to clone you
using your latest syncording.

1095
01:20:12,452 --> 01:20:15,533
Then I'll clone Katherine
using her last syncording.

1096
01:20:15,772 --> 01:20:17,173
You understand?

1097
01:20:17,812 --> 01:20:19,812
Do you see what I'm doing for you?

1098
01:20:20,372 --> 01:20:24,212
You'll be together, neither of you will
remember you promised not to clone her.

1099
01:20:24,413 --> 01:20:25,653
Or that she even died.

1100
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,813
Obviously you won't remember
this conversation.

1101
01:20:37,813 --> 01:20:39,093
You're welcome.

1102
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:03,534
All right, now show me my family.

1103
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:35,095
Bastards. I knew it.

1104
01:22:00,055 --> 01:22:01,735
Your syncording isn't here.

1105
01:22:02,055 --> 01:22:03,855
It was being flown by remote.

1106
01:22:04,055 --> 01:22:05,895
Both of you, get back here now.

1107
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:08,055
Come on.

1108
01:22:20,016 --> 01:22:23,056
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here.

1109
01:22:23,296 --> 01:22:24,856
I'm here to pick up Mr. Drucker.

1110
01:22:29,896 --> 01:22:31,895
It's my charter contract.

1111
01:22:38,136 --> 01:22:40,937
Everything's normal, Mr. Drucker,
but we'll stay alert.

1112
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:42,736
What time are you taking off?

1113
01:22:42,936 --> 01:22:44,456
Take off? I didn't order-

1114
01:22:44,656 --> 01:22:46,496
Your pilot's on his way to reception.

1115
01:22:48,896 --> 01:22:50,176
Now you listen to me.

1116
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,496
Seal the building.
Full security alert.

1117
01:22:52,697 --> 01:22:55,376
Find this pilot.
He is armed and dangerous.

1118
01:22:55,977 --> 01:22:58,536
And get Wiley and some men
up to my office now.

1119
01:22:58,857 --> 01:23:02,457
Freeze the elevators. Shut down
level 2 and 3 parking garages.

1120
01:23:02,937 --> 01:23:05,417
- Zone 6, engineering corridor.
- There. Sector 3.

1121
01:23:09,137 --> 01:23:12,017
He's headed right towards you, Dan.
Turn around!

1122
01:23:13,537 --> 01:23:14,457
Don't try it.

1123
01:23:15,177 --> 01:23:16,617
Get people up the stairwell!

1124
01:23:19,257 --> 01:23:21,577
Teams 3 and 4, close off on him!
Let's go!

1125
01:23:38,737 --> 01:23:41,737
- He shot out a power box.
- He's trashing the whole system.

1126
01:23:41,938 --> 01:23:45,178
We got him trapped.
West stairwell between 13 and 14.

1127
01:23:51,577 --> 01:23:52,738
Let's go!

1128
01:23:58,538 --> 01:24:00,538
Cover the stairwell doors!

1129
01:24:04,698 --> 01:24:06,298
Fire in front of him!

1130
01:24:13,018 --> 01:24:14,299
Okay!

1131
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:16,339
You did pretty good!

1132
01:24:16,539 --> 01:24:18,139
Fooled us at the airport!

1133
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:21,539
Managed to turn this place
into shambles!

1134
01:24:21,739 --> 01:24:23,099
You're the greatest, Dad!

1135
01:24:26,339 --> 01:24:28,459
Mr. Drucker would like to talk to you.

1136
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:31,779
And, of course,
we do have your family!

1137
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:35,059
All right.

1138
01:24:36,059 --> 01:24:37,579
Go get him.

1139
01:24:40,260 --> 01:24:41,179
Well, well.

1140
01:24:43,299 --> 01:24:46,779
- Adam Gibson.
- I wish I could say, "the one and only. "

1141
01:24:47,299 --> 01:24:49,539
Looks like we both went back
on our word.

1142
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:53,059
- You'll find we have more in common-
- Where's my family?

1143
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,620
Right to business.

1144
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,100
An admirable trait.

1145
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:02,460
There they are. All safe and sound.

1146
01:25:02,660 --> 01:25:03,820
For the moment.

1147
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:07,260
Your syncording is not on him...

1148
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,939
...it's not in his whisper craft.

1149
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,981
I knew you'd double-cross me,
so I gave it to my clone.

1150
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,380
Anything happens to me or my family...

1151
01:25:27,581 --> 01:25:30,861
...the next time you see it
will be at your murder trial.

1152
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,141
Dr. Weir didn't tell you.

1153
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:35,901
Tell me what?

1154
01:25:37,421 --> 01:25:39,621
Adam, Adam, Adam.

1155
01:25:42,101 --> 01:25:43,541
He's not the clone.

1156
01:25:47,101 --> 01:25:48,061
You are.

1157
01:25:51,181 --> 01:25:52,701
Ask yourself something.

1158
01:25:53,501 --> 01:25:56,501
You remember anything
after being scanned by my bodyguard?

1159
01:25:56,701 --> 01:25:59,262
I need to check your vision.
Place your chin here.

1160
01:25:59,461 --> 01:26:01,661
Changing places with your friend?

1161
01:26:01,862 --> 01:26:05,181
Buddy, wake up. We're here.
Woodland Mall.

1162
01:26:05,822 --> 01:26:08,261
The salesman at RePet
thought it was...

1163
01:26:08,462 --> 01:26:11,101
...odd you came in twice.

1164
01:26:11,541 --> 01:26:13,141
Asked the same questions...

1165
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:14,502
...twice.

1166
01:26:14,982 --> 01:26:16,942
Still can't make up your mind, huh?

1167
01:26:18,462 --> 01:26:19,902
You lost a dog, right?

1168
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,142
Let me see your chin.

1169
01:26:23,382 --> 01:26:25,462
You cut yourself shaving.

1170
01:26:26,301 --> 01:26:27,302
Your shaving cut?

1171
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:30,342
Easily reproduced.

1172
01:26:31,902 --> 01:26:34,262
So is the scar
from your old war wound.

1173
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,542
I know who I am.

1174
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:40,143
I know you do.

1175
01:26:40,943 --> 01:26:42,222
Talia?

1176
01:26:42,422 --> 01:26:44,302
How many times have you been cloned?

1177
01:26:44,503 --> 01:26:46,463
I've lost count.

1178
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:48,262
There's one way to tell.

1179
01:26:49,183 --> 01:26:50,423
Show him.

1180
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:55,103
It's the only way to track
what generation a clone is.

1181
01:26:55,703 --> 01:26:57,783
See? Four dots means...

1182
01:26:57,983 --> 01:26:59,943
...she's been cloned four times.

1183
01:27:00,143 --> 01:27:01,103
Come on.

1184
01:27:01,343 --> 01:27:03,183
Let's take a look at yours.

1185
01:27:03,983 --> 01:27:05,463
Take a look in the mirror.

1186
01:27:05,663 --> 01:27:08,503
Let's find out if you are
who you think you are.

1187
01:27:16,383 --> 01:27:18,183
Just under your left eye.

1188
01:27:30,864 --> 01:27:33,663
Kind of takes the fun
out of being alive, doesn't it?

1189
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:36,584
So, you see...

1190
01:27:36,784 --> 01:27:38,704
...your family
isn't really your family.

1191
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:40,624
They're his.

1192
01:27:41,424 --> 01:27:44,784
And you, my friend, are in exactly
the same boat as all of us.

1193
01:27:51,944 --> 01:27:54,944
If Adam Gibson gets that syncording
to the authorities...

1194
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:56,545
...we'll all be destroyed.

1195
01:27:57,264 --> 01:27:59,744
If you really love
your wife and kid...

1196
01:27:59,945 --> 01:28:02,344
...you'll tell me
where Adam Gibson is.

1197
01:28:02,705 --> 01:28:05,705
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1198
01:28:06,344 --> 01:28:08,425
You'll tell me where Adam Gibson is.

1199
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:13,505
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1200
01:28:13,984 --> 01:28:16,145
They'll never know you're the clone.

1201
01:28:19,265 --> 01:28:20,745
That, or lose them forever.

1202
01:28:20,945 --> 01:28:24,705
Adam, I'm not making this offer
because I have to.

1203
01:28:24,905 --> 01:28:26,905
I can get everything
from your memories.

1204
01:28:27,105 --> 01:28:29,425
The fact is,
I'd like you to understand...

1205
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,705
...you'd be serving a higher purpose.

1206
01:28:32,705 --> 01:28:36,825
In two years, three tops, I'll control
enough votes to get the laws changed.

1207
01:28:37,706 --> 01:28:41,705
Then we won't have to lose our best
people. Our Mozarts...

1208
01:28:41,906 --> 01:28:43,345
...our Martin Luther Kings.

1209
01:28:43,546 --> 01:28:46,426
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

1210
01:28:48,266 --> 01:28:51,106
We will finally be able
to conquer death.

1211
01:28:59,266 --> 01:29:01,106
And who gets to decide...

1212
01:29:01,306 --> 01:29:02,866
...who lives and who dies?

1213
01:29:03,626 --> 01:29:04,826
You?

1214
01:29:05,386 --> 01:29:06,666
You have a better idea?

1215
01:29:06,866 --> 01:29:07,867
Yeah.

1216
01:29:08,066 --> 01:29:09,426
What about God?

1217
01:29:09,626 --> 01:29:13,546
You're one of those. I suppose you
think science is inherently evil.

1218
01:29:13,747 --> 01:29:17,266
No, I don't think science
is inherently evil.

1219
01:29:17,587 --> 01:29:18,947
But I think you are.

1220
01:29:20,026 --> 01:29:22,346
If you believe God created man
in His own image...

1221
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:25,387
...you believe He gave man
power to understand evolution...

1222
01:29:25,586 --> 01:29:28,746
...to exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code.

1223
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,787
To do exactly what I'm doing.

1224
01:29:31,787 --> 01:29:34,467
I'm just taking over
where God left off.

1225
01:29:37,307 --> 01:29:41,467
If you really believe that,
then you should clone yourself...

1226
01:29:41,747 --> 01:29:43,387
...while you're still alive.

1227
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:46,828
Why's that? So I can understand
your unique perspective?

1228
01:29:47,027 --> 01:29:50,067
No. So you can go fuck yourself.

1229
01:29:56,507 --> 01:29:59,988
Now you'll tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!

1230
01:30:03,307 --> 01:30:04,707
You won't find it in my head.

1231
01:30:05,748 --> 01:30:08,468
I told him to hide it
so I wouldn't know where it is.

1232
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:10,748
- We'll see about that.
- Yeah, we will.

1233
01:30:11,028 --> 01:30:12,708
Let's go. Get in here.

1234
01:30:13,108 --> 01:30:14,388
Come on!

1235
01:30:14,588 --> 01:30:15,748
Come on!

1236
01:30:16,788 --> 01:30:17,948
Come on!

1237
01:30:18,148 --> 01:30:19,868
Fine! Have it your way!

1238
01:30:51,789 --> 01:30:53,349
That didn't hurt so bad.

1239
01:30:55,029 --> 01:30:56,069
Asshole.

1240
01:31:05,469 --> 01:31:07,070
Let's go back a few minutes.

1241
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:14,949
Here's Drucker's syncording.

1242
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:16,670
There's the other one.

1243
01:31:16,869 --> 01:31:18,349
Keep this.

1244
01:31:18,870 --> 01:31:21,629
If I'm not back in an hour,
you know what to do.

1245
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:25,870
Don't worry. If anything happens
to you or my family...

1246
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:28,670
...I'm gonna destroy
that son of a bitch.

1247
01:31:35,750 --> 01:31:37,310
You got the location?

1248
01:31:37,670 --> 01:31:40,910
The airport. I was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.

1249
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,350
Let's go.

1250
01:31:42,670 --> 01:31:44,670
Betrayed by your own mind.

1251
01:31:55,591 --> 01:31:57,351
Wait! Wait!

1252
01:31:58,191 --> 01:31:59,151
What?

1253
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:01,071
They staged that scene for us.

1254
01:32:01,311 --> 01:32:04,071
The other one sat behind him
so we couldn't see him.

1255
01:32:04,271 --> 01:32:06,831
The bastard faked his own syncording.

1256
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:11,671
One hid and this one avoided looking
at him so he wouldn't be in his memory.

1257
01:32:11,871 --> 01:32:13,591
You mean the other one's here too?

1258
01:32:13,791 --> 01:32:15,031
Yes, that's correct.

1259
01:32:15,271 --> 01:32:18,351
Now put out another alert.
This one is the diversion!

1260
01:32:24,432 --> 01:32:26,671
He smashes the cameras,
gets captured...

1261
01:32:26,872 --> 01:32:30,351
...meanwhile, the other one strolls in
and takes his wife and kid.

1262
01:33:09,393 --> 01:33:10,712
Idiot!

1263
01:33:15,993 --> 01:33:17,513
Natalie, Clara.

1264
01:33:18,033 --> 01:33:20,673
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Daddy?

1265
01:33:29,033 --> 01:33:29,953
Don't worry, sir.

1266
01:33:30,153 --> 01:33:31,313
Get him up.

1267
01:33:32,633 --> 01:33:33,873
I'm scared, Dad.

1268
01:33:34,073 --> 01:33:35,553
What's going on?

1269
01:33:35,753 --> 01:33:39,753
- This isn't because of the cigar?
- No. I'll explain to you later.

1270
01:33:47,193 --> 01:33:50,154
Don't worry. He's not going anywhere.
We'll get him.

1271
01:33:51,953 --> 01:33:53,394
Wait.

1272
01:33:53,714 --> 01:33:55,474
Talia, you go. You two stay here.

1273
01:33:57,834 --> 01:33:59,554
Have them block all the exits.

1274
01:34:00,753 --> 01:34:01,674
Henderson...

1275
01:34:01,874 --> 01:34:04,274
...seal off the tank area,
levels 6 and 7.

1276
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:12,154
I'm trying. Give me a minute.

1277
01:34:12,354 --> 01:34:14,274
And get us some power up here.

1278
01:34:15,395 --> 01:34:18,634
Don't move. My daughter
is right inside that door.

1279
01:34:19,194 --> 01:34:21,955
I don't want to expose her
to any graphic violence.

1280
01:34:22,154 --> 01:34:24,634
She already gets enough of that
from the media.

1281
01:34:24,835 --> 01:34:26,394
Put your weapons down.

1282
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:28,515
Nice and easy. Good.

1283
01:34:29,075 --> 01:34:30,794
Now, when you go inside...

1284
01:34:30,995 --> 01:34:31,914
...you say...

1285
01:34:32,474 --> 01:34:34,435
Have a nice flight, little girl.

1286
01:34:34,835 --> 01:34:36,554
They're friends of Daddy's.

1287
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:38,635
All right, let's go.

1288
01:34:46,835 --> 01:34:50,475
We'll have a little midnight flight
with Daddy and Mommy.

1289
01:34:50,675 --> 01:34:51,955
There we are.

1290
01:34:52,155 --> 01:34:53,115
All right?

1291
01:34:55,435 --> 01:34:56,956
There you go, sir.

1292
01:34:57,636 --> 01:34:58,835
Wiley.

1293
01:34:59,035 --> 01:35:00,475
Go.

1294
01:35:03,195 --> 01:35:05,115
Wiley, just wait one second.

1295
01:35:14,316 --> 01:35:15,436
Not again.

1296
01:35:19,836 --> 01:35:21,156
And don't bring him back.

1297
01:35:21,395 --> 01:35:24,436
Stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.

1298
01:35:24,796 --> 01:35:26,356
God.

1299
01:35:26,556 --> 01:35:28,556
I'll be dead in 20 minutes, tops.

1300
01:35:31,397 --> 01:35:33,396
But what better place, right?

1301
01:35:34,356 --> 01:35:36,556
Henderson? Where's my power?

1302
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:38,876
Coming on-line now, sir.

1303
01:35:39,077 --> 01:35:41,917
Get all exits blocked. All exits!

1304
01:35:45,637 --> 01:35:46,557
Shit.

1305
01:35:52,597 --> 01:35:54,316
Go start warming up a blank.

1306
01:35:54,517 --> 01:35:57,357
Do a fresh syncording.
I want my mind up-to-the-minute.

1307
01:36:45,998 --> 01:36:47,838
Here it is. This is a fresh one.

1308
01:36:48,038 --> 01:36:50,078
This will be a complete syncording.

1309
01:37:03,438 --> 01:37:04,799
Is that Talia?

1310
01:37:05,798 --> 01:37:07,119
Go help her.

1311
01:37:08,518 --> 01:37:09,839
We'll find them.

1312
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:10,440
- What have you got?
- Tanks 3 and 4, nothing.

1313
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:13,000
Okay, go. Take the back walk.

1314
01:39:21,602 --> 01:39:22,923
No.

1315
01:39:33,682 --> 01:39:34,843
Oh, God.

1316
01:40:22,804 --> 01:40:24,084
Oh, no.

1317
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:45,244
Take her to your mother's...

1318
01:40:45,444 --> 01:40:47,005
...and stay there until I come.

1319
01:40:47,204 --> 01:40:48,485
Come with us, Daddy.

1320
01:40:48,684 --> 01:40:51,284
I have to help a friend, okay? Bye.

1321
01:40:51,484 --> 01:40:52,644
I love you.

1322
01:41:14,165 --> 01:41:15,885
Wiley, you shot me!

1323
01:41:19,125 --> 01:41:20,725
Oh, right. That was you.

1324
01:41:24,085 --> 01:41:25,445
I've got to get dressed.

1325
01:41:28,406 --> 01:41:30,766
You're not even going to wait...

1326
01:41:30,965 --> 01:41:32,285
...until I die?

1327
01:41:32,725 --> 01:41:33,965
Would you?

1328
01:41:34,925 --> 01:41:36,086
Come on.

1329
01:41:36,445 --> 01:41:37,846
Get it off.

1330
01:41:38,726 --> 01:41:41,406
You got blood on the jacket.
Jesus Christ.

1331
01:41:58,327 --> 01:41:59,446
What?

1332
01:42:04,806 --> 01:42:05,766
What?

1333
01:42:07,046 --> 01:42:08,366
What?

1334
01:42:14,166 --> 01:42:15,126
Look...

1335
01:42:16,287 --> 01:42:17,927
...we can make a deal.

1336
01:42:18,646 --> 01:42:21,447
I didn't do anything to you.
It was all him.

1337
01:42:22,847 --> 01:42:24,286
Listen to me.

1338
01:42:24,807 --> 01:42:27,167
I can rebuild all this
in a very short time.

1339
01:42:27,407 --> 01:42:29,007
I can still save you, Adam.

1340
01:42:29,206 --> 01:42:30,287
Save me?

1341
01:42:30,487 --> 01:42:34,167
We put defects in the clone DNA
to give them short life spans.

1342
01:42:34,407 --> 01:42:37,968
Want to know what you'll die of?
How long you've got to live?

1343
01:42:38,167 --> 01:42:40,728
We can go right upstairs
and look it up.

1344
01:43:15,408 --> 01:43:17,088
We all have to die someday.

1345
01:43:17,329 --> 01:43:18,768
We don't have to die.

1346
01:43:19,728 --> 01:43:23,728
I'm offering you the chance
to live forever. Never aging.

1347
01:43:24,609 --> 01:43:26,489
Perfect in every way.

1348
01:43:26,688 --> 01:43:28,648
Perfect? Like you?

1349
01:43:29,728 --> 01:43:30,649
Look.

1350
01:43:31,368 --> 01:43:32,728
Here is your " perfection. "

1351
01:43:40,569 --> 01:43:42,009
Oh, God.

1352
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:49,209
There's no need to panic.
I can fix this.

1353
01:43:49,449 --> 01:43:50,809
You won't fix anything.

1354
01:43:51,009 --> 01:43:52,449
It's over. It's finished.

1355
01:43:52,889 --> 01:43:54,009
It's finished.

1356
01:44:12,369 --> 01:44:14,370
When I said
you should screw yourself...

1357
01:44:14,569 --> 01:44:17,050
...I didn't mean for you
to take it literally.

1358
01:44:45,970 --> 01:44:47,930
Go after him.

1359
01:44:49,211 --> 01:44:50,811
Get him.

1360
01:44:52,731 --> 01:44:54,051
Check the roof!

1361
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:55,491
You! Up top!

1362
01:46:08,373 --> 01:46:09,733
Come on!

1363
01:46:32,374 --> 01:46:34,533
- Can you fly this?
- Better than you can.

1364
01:46:34,734 --> 01:46:37,133
Good. Because your shooting sucks.

1365
01:46:45,573 --> 01:46:47,054
Let's get out of here.

1366
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:49,056
Shit.

1367
01:47:58,695 --> 01:47:59,935
Come on!

1368
01:48:20,576 --> 01:48:21,696
Try to climb over me!

1369
01:48:30,777 --> 01:48:32,377
Come on! Hurry up!

1370
01:48:43,777 --> 01:48:44,737
Come on!

1371
01:49:05,577 --> 01:49:06,537
Shit!

1372
01:49:32,418 --> 01:49:34,018
You know, I keep wondering...

1373
01:49:34,658 --> 01:49:36,658
...am I really human?

1374
01:49:36,858 --> 01:49:38,178
Do I have a soul?

1375
01:49:38,658 --> 01:49:41,819
Well, your DNA scan
came back normal, didn't it?

1376
01:49:42,018 --> 01:49:44,178
Yeah. Zero defects.

1377
01:49:44,419 --> 01:49:46,538
Just like a RePet commercial.

1378
01:49:46,739 --> 01:49:49,538
If you're not human,
they would have mentioned it.

1379
01:49:53,138 --> 01:49:55,298
All right, enough philosophy.

1380
01:49:55,499 --> 01:49:56,859
I better get going.

1381
01:49:57,058 --> 01:49:59,138
I've got 3 weeks at sea
to figure it out.

1382
01:49:59,379 --> 01:50:01,419
Hurry if you want to see Clara.

1383
01:50:01,619 --> 01:50:04,738
Thanks for letting me say goodbye
to your family.

1384
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:06,219
Now, wait.

1385
01:50:06,459 --> 01:50:08,899
This is your family too.

1386
01:50:09,379 --> 01:50:12,299
You were willing to die to save them.

1387
01:50:12,619 --> 01:50:14,699
Think about that
while you're at sea...

1388
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:17,099
...wondering if you're
really human or not.

1389
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:19,099
Because if that's not being human...

1390
01:50:19,339 --> 01:50:21,219
...I don't know what is.

1391
01:50:23,019 --> 01:50:24,299
Thanks.

1392
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:32,219
Hello, everybody.

1393
01:50:33,179 --> 01:50:35,099
- Look what I brought.
- A kitty!

1394
01:50:37,980 --> 01:50:40,419
Oh, Sadie.

1395
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:42,020
I thought that...

1396
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,380
...Hank's cat was a-

1397
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:44,580
She is.

1398
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:46,780
But you hate RePets.

1399
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:49,220
Well, I changed my mind.

1400
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:51,180
You old softie.

1401
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:53,500
Can we keep her?

1402
01:50:53,701 --> 01:50:55,060
- Please?
- Of course.

1403
01:50:55,300 --> 01:50:58,100
That's why I brought her home.
Put her down.

1404
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:59,301
Good.

1405
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:01,660
Thank you so much.
