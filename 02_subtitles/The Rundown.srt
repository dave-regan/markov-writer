1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,800
I just love mushrooms,
One of my favorites,
or as I call it,,,

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:33,700
,,, the king of mushrooms,
is the porcini,

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, stop right there,

4
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,900
Don't be alarmed,

5
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:42,800
There's a lot of confusion
in this country between porcini,,,

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,400
,,, the Italian name, and cèpes,
which is the French name,

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,500
,,, the Italian name, and cèpes,
which is the French name,

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,600
They're fat and they're earthy,

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,800
Now, the porcini is most often seen
dried here in this country,

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,700
And they would always be labeled,,,

11
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,500
- ,,, dried porcinis, not dried cèpes.
- Beck!

12
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,400
- Come on!
- They are very, very, very flavorful,

13
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,100
It's about time.
I've been waiting.

14
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,000
Man, you're lucky to be getting in.
It's an extremely private party tonight.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
- What's he drinking?
- Jägermeister and Cristal.

16
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,400
Great.

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,800
- Security?
- No, but we do have a slight problem.

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Have fun.

19
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,100
What's the problem?

20
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,900
That's your problem.
The guy on the left
is Jalil Johnson.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,500
- I think he's the left tackle.
- Jamal Johnson.
Defensive end.

22
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,200
The best defensive lineman Notre
Dame's produced in the last 20 years,
Maybe ever,

23
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,100
The guy on his left
is Kambui Jackson.

24
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,500
He ran for 2000 yards last year,
All-Pro five years in a row,

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,500
The guy in the headband,
that's Fernando Lewis.
Middle linebacker.

26
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,900
Plays a lot like Ray Lewis,

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,700
- He just hits harder.
- Whatever. I'm not into football.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,200
The other two guys
are Jimmy Coggeshell...

29
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,100
...and David Mulaire.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,100
One's from US C,
The other one's from Ohio State,

31
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:35,400
Stay down, bitch!
The guy you're looking for is there.
Brian Knappmiller.

32
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
Throws like Brett Favre,

33
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,100
Bets like Pete Rose,

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,800
So I'm telling this cat, I'm like,
"Yo, I know it's you that jumped.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,900
I saw you.
Don't tell me it's not you."
He's like, "I don't know."

36
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,700
- Excuse me.
- "Trust me. It's you, I know."

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you guys.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,100
- I apologize. I need...
- My man.

39
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,800
I ain't got no hookups to tryout
camps. You just gotta show up.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,700
I think you'll be all right.
So I'm telling the cat,
"I don't want..."

41
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,500
Excuse me. I'm not here
to talk about tryouts.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:12,200
- Lf I could have a minute...
- I got it. Pass me that.
Who do I make this out to, man?

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,000
Who do I make it out to?
What's your name?

44
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,800
- Beck.
- Beck?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,300
B-E-C-K.

46
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,900
- What's up?
- What's happening?

47
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,900
Here you go.
Knock yourself out.

48
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,700
- All right?
- Thank you.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,500
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna come back, or what?

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,700
Excuse me.

51
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,200
- I'm really...
- What are you doing, man?

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,200
A couple of months ago, you made
wagers with an associate of mine.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,600
- Two, three months ago.
- What's up, Knappy?

54
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,200
- Nothing. It's good. Enjoy your drink.
- What's up?

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,100
Yo, bets? You embarrass me
in front of friends about bets?

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,700
I don't mean to embarrass you.
This is embarrassing to me.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,200
- $50,000. You might remember.
- Yeah, I know what it is, man.

58
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Listen, there's a G to get me started.
Now do me a favor.

59
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,100
Tell your man I'll see him Monday
with the rest...

60
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,800
...and not to send anybody else
to see me, all right?

61
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Brian.

62
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm gonna need some collateral
from you.
What?

63
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,900
I'm gonna need the ring.

64
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,200
- I'm sorry.
- You're...? Are you...?

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Slip it under the table,
on the low-Iow.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,800
- I'll make sure you get it back.
- On the low-Iow.

67
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,500
- I'll give it to you. Want a drink too?
- Thank you.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Take the ring.
That's what I think about that.

69
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,700
Get the hell on, man.
Go, man! Go!

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,000
- Do something with this.
- You heard the man.
Yo, man, get up!

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,700
Okay.

72
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,500
Yeah, that's right, playboy, walk.
Go on, man!

73
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
You wanna jump?

74
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Get your ass out of here.

75
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,000
You all right?

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,900
This shit burns.

77
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
Hey, it's me.

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh, yeah, he's here.
We got a problem, though.

79
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,200
He's got the entire offensive line.
The entire offensive line is here.

80
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Let me do it another night.
How about that?

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,800
They've got a shot
at repeating this year.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,400
I do not want to hurt them.
I don't want to go out...

83
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,200
Okay, Billy.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,400
Knappmiller!
You got two choices.

85
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,700
Option A, you give me the ring.

86
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,600
Option B,
I make you give me the ring.

87
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll take B.

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Wrong choice.

89
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,200
Okay.

90
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Yeah, put him down, man!

91
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,000
- Yo, what's with all this hostility?
- You should have taken option A.

92
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Are you all right, mate?

93
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,300
Are you okay?

94
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,400
Thanks, mate.

95
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,600
- There he is.
- Why'd you send him, Billy?
Martin? Oh, he was just a backup.

96
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,000
After I got your call,
I wasn't so sure you could deliver.

97
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
- What happened?
- He stole it from me!

98
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,200
He got you
with those beanbags? No.

99
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,900
It is gonna be 10 off your vig,
anyway, you know.

100
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,300
Billy, you know I've got plans!
Stop nickel-and-diming me.

101
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,800
It's a tough business,
the restaurant business.

102
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,500
I hear 75 percent of them fail
the first year. Do you know why?

103
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Undercapitalization, that's why.
I don't think...

104
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,800
Billy, I want out, I want a new life.
I want my money, and I want it now!

105
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Now?

106
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,700
Now.

107
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,600
Okay.

108
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,300
One job.

109
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,200
One job, I wipe your slate clean...

110
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
...and you have your restaurant.

111
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,700
Come on, open it up.

112
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,400
Come on.

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
That's a photo
of Travis Alfred Walker.

114
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,300
Stanford dropout, treasure hunter.
Only to date...

115
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,500
...the only thing he's found
is trouble.

116
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,500
- Did you say, "Walker"?
- My son.

117
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,400
From my third marriage.
Lasted about three minutes.

118
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
That picture was taken
two months ago...

119
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,800
...in some gold-mining town called El
Dorado in the middle of the Amazon.

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,400
- How much?
- 250 large.

121
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,000
For that much,
why not invite him back yourself?

122
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,700
- The boy doesn't trust me.
- Kidnapping's gonna help.

123
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Is that sarcasm?

124
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,800
You wanna be sarcastic,
do it to your monkey friends!

125
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,900
You do not do it to me!
Do you understand?

126
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,300
I'm sorry, Billy.

127
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,800
You're goddamn right you are.

128
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,800
- What'd he do?
- Pissed off the wrong people.

129
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,200
I don't have to remind you
what happens when you do that, do I?

130
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,000
So I bought him some forgiveness.
But if I don't bring him back
to face the music...

131
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,400
...you know damn well
that I can't carry a tune.

132
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,400
So you deliver my boy back here,
you bring him right through that door...

133
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,800
...you walk out of this house
a free man, with a restaurant.

134
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,600
Is that duct tape?

135
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,100
Don't worry there, little fella.
Walk by faith, not by sight.

136
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Will you look at that?
We can't land now.

137
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,500
- Why? Why can't we land?
- They got the bulls on the ground.

138
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,600
"Booze on the grind"?

139
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
The bulls. On the ground.
Cattle down there.

140
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,600
- Cows?
- Yeah.

141
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,200
I'll give them a wee fright there.
Get moving! Come on!

142
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,900
Out of me way!

143
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,300
Out the way, you!

144
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,700
Move it! Move it now!

145
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
Out my way!

146
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,900
Out me way!

147
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,000
All right there, little fella.
Okay, gotcha.

148
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,500
What did I tell you about the lamp?
My needle was totally knackered.

149
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,000
Rpm's all over the shop.

150
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,300
- Is this the only road in and out?
- Lf you wanna stay alive.

151
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,300
- Why is that?
- There. That's the jungle, little fella.
You got anacondas in there.

152
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,700
Poison arrow frogs, black flies,
bullet ants.

153
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,900
If they don't get you,
the rebels will.

154
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,700
- What?
- Rebels. That's what I'm telling you.

155
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,500
To them, Cornelius Hatcher's
built a Babylon in paradise.

156
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,200
- Built a what?
- A Babylon.

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,300
Yeah, that mine is as close as a man
can come to the gates of hell...

158
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,300
...while his heart's still beating.

159
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,700
The Sunday school picnic is over,
I'll tell you that.

160
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,800
Stay out of the jungle,
little fella, okay?

161
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,900
I found these flowers growing
in the deepest parts of the jungle.

162
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,400
I mean, as far as I can tell,
no one's ever identified them...

163
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,200
...which means I'm responsible
for naming them.

164
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,900
I can only think of one word
that fits something so beautiful.

165
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,400
Mariana.

166
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,400
How much do you want?

167
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
- What?
- How much?

168
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,800
I need your uncle's boat.
A day or two, max. Mariana...

169
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,400
You borrow my car,
bring it back with no windshield.

170
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,800
- My brother's scooter...
- That wasn't my fault.

171
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,900
Now you want to borrow
my uncle's boat?

172
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,100
"I found it, I found it." You'll never
find this Garbo of yours.

173
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,100
- It's "Gato," I told you.
- Gato.

174
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,200
It's out there, Mariana.
I know exactly where it is.

175
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,200
But I need that boat.

176
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,700
- How much?
- I told you, l...
No. How much is your Gato worth?

177
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,300
This is a very significant
academic find.

178
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,200
- How much?
- It's not about money.

179
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,000
- You lie like a little girl, Travis.
- I'm not lying.

180
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,300
If I get the boat for you,
you have to take me with you.

181
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,700
Ridiculous.
We're talking about a boat.

182
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,300
- And we split the take 50-50.
- I've been doing all the work, okay?

183
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,100
- I found it. No way.
- 50-50, Travis.

184
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
- 70-30.
- 50-50.

185
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,100
- 60-40.
- 50-50, and I get off work at 6.
Then we can go and get your Gato.

186
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,800
You're evil.

187
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,900
- Thank you.
- Whatever.
For the flowers.

188
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Harvey! We're here
to see your brother.

189
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,200
Where's he from?
- He's an American,
- You got a gun?

190
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,000
No, I don't like guns.
Check him.

191
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,800
- What's the current payout?
- Give me a payout for Quadrant 3.

192
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,100
2425, down 20 percent.

193
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
Checked him?

194
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,200
All right, let's go.

195
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,800
Come on.

196
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Come on.

197
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,500
I never met an American
who didn't like guns.

198
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,800
Tell them to dig harder.

199
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,800
If only it were that simple,
eh, Mr. Beck?

200
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,500
- How do you know my name?
- When a man of your dimensions...

201
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,200
...travels all this way
to visit a place like this...
...it arouses the curiosity.

202
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
What can I do for you?

203
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,900
Do you know this man?

204
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
Travis Walker.

205
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,600
I let him excavate
around the mine...

206
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
...allow him to rent a room
in my town...

207
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
...all for a fair 60 percent
of anything he might unearth.

208
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,700
- Where can I find him?
- Follow the bullshit.

209
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,500
- Guy's mouth should be in the circus.
- Brother, please.

210
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,400
- Do you have business with him?
- I do.

211
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,700
What kind of business?
I love business.

212
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
- It's personal.
- So...

213
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,600
...why come to me?
- When I'm a guest in a man's house...

214
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:55,600
...I don't reach into his refrigerator
without permission.

215
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,300
Refrigerator.

216
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,600
I want to show you something,
Mr. Beck, please.

217
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,100
Does that look like
a refrigerator to you?

218
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,200
Looks more like hell.

219
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,100
Where you see hell, I see
a spellbinding sense of purpose.

220
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:27,700
I see the value of keeping your eye
on the ball.

221
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
When a bride slips the ring
on her finger,,,

222
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,300
,,, when a businessman lays his hands
on a Rolex,,,

223
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,900
,,, when a rapper gets a shiny new
tooth, this is that cost, Mr, Beck,

224
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,900
My horror for their beauty.
My hell for their little slice of heaven.

225
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,600
Somebody's gotta keep his eye
on the ball,

226
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,800
That somebody is me, Mr, Beck,
I am down here every day
keeping my eye on the ball,

227
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,500
That's just a simple fact of life,

228
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,200
And if you're bold enough
to face that cold, hard fact,,,

229
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,600
...you can make a lot of money.

230
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,700
- What do you want with the kid?
- I've come to take him home.

231
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,900
That'll cost you $ 10,000.

232
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,500
- I need to borrow the jeep.
- Wait a minute, friend.
I'll give you $ 1000.

233
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
I'll give you $ 1000.

234
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,800
I need you to take my bag back to
the plane, keep the engine running.

235
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
- Can you do that?
- For $ 1000?

236
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,200
- That's right.
- I'll find a way.

237
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,500
Declan. I'm gonna be coming fast.

238
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,400
American?

239
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah.

240
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Where from?

241
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,400
Someplace that's got bartenders.

242
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,900
What can I get you?

243
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,700
I'll take a beer.

244
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,400
Nice flowers.

245
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
"The smiling fool."

246
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,200
Back in the States, Brazil nuts
like these go for $ 15 a pound.

247
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,600
Well, those fell off the tree
out back.

248
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,900
And around here,
we don't call them Brazil nuts.

249
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,700
- What do you call them?
- Well, we're in Brazil...
...so we just call them nuts.

250
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,200
- Fair enough.
- What brings you to the Amazon...

251
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
...other than the food and drink,
of course?

252
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,400
- I'm looking for a man.
- What's your type?

253
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
His name's Travis Walker.

254
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,900
Brown hair. He's in his 20s.
Wears a blue shirt, jeans.

255
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Right now he's got a real
bewildered look on his face.

256
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
- Do I know you?
- Name's Beck.

257
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,500
- What can I do for you?
- I need you to make a choice for me.
A choice?

258
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,200
- Option A or option B.
- What's option A?

259
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Option A is, you and I
walk out of here nice and easy...
...and drive back to the airstrip.

260
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,100
And then we begin our long journey
back to Los Angeles.

261
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,100
There'll be no blood,
no broken bones...

262
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,200
...and no problems.

263
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,500
- What's in Los Angeles?
- Your father.

264
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,200
- What's option B?
- Pretty much the opposite of A.

265
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,200
But I wouldn't recommend that one.

266
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,900
I'll take option C.

267
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,700
Travis, there is no option C.

268
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,400
Really?

269
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,200
Are you sure?

270
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I mean, big boy,
there's always an option C.

271
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,500
So angry!

272
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,500
- Shut up.
- Shut up!

273
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,400
Like I said,
there is no option C.

274
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,800
- Let me introduce you to option C.
- Mr. Beck...

275
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,900
...there's been a slight change
in the narrative.

276
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,100
- An unexpected twist, you might say.
- Can I have a beer, please?

277
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,700
Mr. Hatcher, I was just gonna
come find you when this...
The kid stays.

278
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,700
- I paid you.
- Well, fortunately...

279
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,400
...I had my fingers crossed
the whole time.
Apparently, young Mr. Walker...

280
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,900
...may have stumbled
onto a trinket of value.

281
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,900
And as he's located it
in my jungle...

282
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,200
...I'm gonna need him
to lead me to it.

283
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, so let's go, dickhead.
Don't call me a dickhead,
you dickhead.

284
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,800
- Did you find it or not, asshole?
- What, asshole?

285
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,900
- Did you find it or not?
- What's that?

286
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,700
- Did you find it or not, asshole?
- Don't!
Hey, don't rock the boat.

287
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,900
Okay.

288
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,800
- I don't want any trouble.
- Leave now. Don't come back.

289
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
- And the 10,000?
- Consider it tax deductible.

290
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
A contribution
to your personal health fund.

291
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,700
With all due respect, Mr. Hatcher...

292
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,800
...I'm feeling pretty healthy.
- Oh, yeah?
Walk.

293
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,000
Don't make waves.

294
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,300
You're gonna kill us all, Mr. Beck?

295
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I tried to be reasonable.

296
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,400
That's not the way to do business.

297
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,200
You should've kept the gun.

298
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,200
You're dead already.
You just don't know it yet.

299
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,100
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?

300
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:00,900
This is option B?
Are you kidding me?
Quiet.

301
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,300
You're dead. You're so dead.

302
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,600
We won't get out of here.
All this land, Hatcher owns it.

303
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,400
The road, the air,
Hatcher owns it all.

304
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,800
- Shut up.
- Whatever my dad is paying you...

305
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,300
...I will double it.
- No.

306
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,800
- I'll quadruple it.
- No.

307
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
- Double it and quadruple it.
- No.
You're being unreasonable!

308
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,800
- I'll give you a chance to reconsider.
- You get one more chance to shut up.

309
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,300
Is that your final answer?

310
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:33,700
For what it's worth,
I hope you enjoy the fall.

311
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,200
- Yeah, what fall?
- This fall.

312
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,200
Come on, big boy,
where's the frigging keys?

313
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,100
All right.

314
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,600
Travis?

315
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,300
Good God!

316
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,000
Travis!

317
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,100
- I'm not going back.
- Oh, you're going back.

318
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,500
No way.

319
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,400
- Right now.
- Who the hell do you think you are?

320
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,900
You come into my town,
mess up my bar...

321
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,400
...and you eyeball my woman?
- Eyeball your woman?

322
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,900
It's on.

323
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,800
What's this?

324
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,300
Who is this? Is he your friend?
Do you know him?
Do you? Say hello.

325
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,200
Say hello. Say hello.

326
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,400
Are you finished?
Let's go.

327
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,400
Big boy, you like thunderstorms?

328
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,600
Bet you do, right?

329
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,200
- Little thunder?
- Stop it.

330
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,600
- Little lightning?
- Stop!

331
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,900
Thunder? Lightning?
Thunder? Lightning? Ears...

332
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,700
You done beating me up?
Let's go.

333
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,400
- I'm tired of this.
- You win.

334
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
Come on! Go to sleep.

335
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,200
Go to sleep. Night-night.

336
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,000
Night-night. Go to sleep now!
Come on!

337
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,600
Obviously, we got off
on the wrong foot here.

338
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,900
So I'm gonna be completely
candid with you.

339
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,700
Have you ever heard
of the Gato do Diabo?

340
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,400
- The Devil's Cat?
- You're gonna stop speaking now.
All right. It's...

341
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,100
It's a priceless object, man.

342
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,300
Forged out of pure gold.

343
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,300
- Worth millions.
- You said priceless.

344
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,400
You do not want to argue semantics
with a Ph.D. Candidate.

345
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,200
- Ph.D.?
- Yeah.

346
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,400
I am really very close
to being Dr. Travis Walker.

347
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,300
You dropped out of Stanford
after two semesters, Einstein.

348
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,300
So I'm fairly close.
Closer than you.

349
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,700
Close to getting your ass
kicked again.

350
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:45,900
Wait, wait, wait!
The Gato is real, all right?

351
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,800
I know where to find it.
- I'll split it with you, 80-20.
- Move!

352
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,100
70-30?

353
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,800
You're a very unpleasant individual,
you know that?

354
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,700
You think they're dead?
What am I, psychic?

355
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,700
I'm gonna cut that kid's nose off.

356
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,400
No, Harvey.

357
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,400
You want the Gato
because if the bad guys get it...
...they won't need us anymore.

358
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,500
There'll be no one to work the mine.
You want to work the mine?

359
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,700
There are two men in that jungle
who are trying to steal from me.

360
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,900
I feel like a little boy
who's lost his first tooth...

361
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:04,700
...put it under his pillow,
waiting for the tooth fairy to come.

362
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,800
Only, two evil burglars
have crept in my window...

363
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,600
...and snatched it
before she could get here.

364
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Wait a second. Do you understand
the concept of the tooth fairy?

365
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,400
Explain it to them.

366
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,100
You find a tooth,
you put it under your pillow.

367
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,800
The fairy comes...

368
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
...waiting for the tooth.

369
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:44,300
Wait. She takes the goddamn thing,
gives you a quarter!
They got my tooth!

370
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,800
I want it back.

371
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,700
I have to ask you,
back at the bar, man. That was crazy!

372
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,700
No guns. Strip, toss, toss, strip.

373
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,800
- Didn't I tell you to be quiet?
- I know, but what is that?

374
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Some kind of nouveau samurai code?
You got a problem with guns?

375
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:19,400
They take me to a place
I don't wanna go.
Where do they take you?

376
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,000
To a place you
don't wanna see me go. Walk!

377
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,300
How often do you work out?

378
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,000
Let me get this straight,
- You never use guns?
- No.

379
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,900
- Never?
- Never.

380
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,600
What if your best friend
was gonna die?
No guns.

381
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,400
Santa would do it
to save his best friend.
Do I look like Santa Claus?

382
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,300
- Do I look like Santa Claus to you?
- What is it?

383
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,600
Guns make you um pouco louco?
Bang-bang crazy?

384
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:54,400
I pick up guns, bad things happen.
I don't like that.

385
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,100
- What kind of things?
- Very bad things, Travis. Walk.

386
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,000
- What about knives?
- Move!

387
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,600
My father doesn't share
the same distaste.

388
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,800
- He's your father. He won't kill you.
- All he cares about...

389
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,300
...is what's good for business.
Now, the question is, Mr. Beck...

390
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,400
...what's good for your business?
You don't like money?

391
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,200
I don't make deals
with people like you.

392
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,000
- You don't even know me.
- You're like every jackass I take down.

393
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,500
First they try to run, then fight,
then they try to negotiate.

394
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,700
When that fails, they do what you're
about to do when you realize it's over.

395
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,500
Oh, yeah? What's that?

396
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,300
You're gonna get down on your hands
and knees and beg me for a break.

397
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Well, guess what.
I don't give breaks.

398
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,900
No breaks.

399
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:45,000
You don't understand the situation.
You borrowed money
from the wrong guy.

400
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:49,400
You slept with the wrong guy's wife.
I don't care.

401
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,800
Your mistake.

402
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,100
What about you, Mr. Beck?
Haven't you ever made a mistake?

403
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,100
I know! Move.

404
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,600
No breaks. That's lame.

405
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,200
No breaks!
No, I don't give breaks.

406
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,300
Santa Claus doesn't give
any breaks.

407
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,900
- Should've been at the airstrip by now.
- Like I'm gonna help.
I didn't ask for your help.

408
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,300
- What are you doing?
- I have to pee.

409
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,300
- Pee in your pants. Move.
- No.

410
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,200
I've let you push me around
this jungle for, like, five hours.

411
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,200
You've been very aggressive, and I'm
not moving until you let me pee.

412
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,000
If you wanna keep going, you'll have
to carry me. I'll pee on your head.

413
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,900
You threatening me?
You threatening me with pee?

414
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,800
Well, yeah,
if you don't let me pee here.

415
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,800
Fine. You win.

416
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,600
Pee.

417
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,700
- Will you unzip me?
- No, I won't.

418
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,900
- You wanna pee, you got 30 seconds.
- How can with I my hands cuffed?
Find a way. Pee.

419
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,100
Come on.

420
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,400
Don't make it weird.

421
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Please?

422
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
Don't breathe, don't say a word.

423
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,900
Don't even look at me.
Look over there.

424
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,800
Thanks, man.

425
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,400
Oh, shit.

426
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,900
I can't get it out!

427
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,000
- Could you just help...?
- No. Hell, no.

428
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,900
Come on! Son of a...!

429
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,600
Come on, come on!

430
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,300
Come on! Oh, hey. Hey, I got it.

431
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,600
Congratulations.
You got 30 seconds. Hurry up.

432
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,700
Don't listen to Tiny Tim, okay?

433
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,900
You're the real big boy.
Everybody knows it.

434
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,700
Ready? One, two, three, go.

435
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:41,000
One, two, three, go, go, go, go!
Oh, yeah.

436
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm going.

437
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,100
Oh, boy.

438
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,900
What...? What is this?

439
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,000
What is...?

440
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
Travis! Hey!

441
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:06,300
Welcome to the jungle, tough guy!

442
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,800
Looks like big boy
got himself pig-snared!

443
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,800
Hey! Hey!
I've got the keys to your cuffs.

444
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,500
- Shit.
- I'll tell you what you've got, pal.

445
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:18,600
- You've got problems.
- That's... Don't do it, Travis.

446
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:23,300
Hey. Hey, get me down. Travis.

447
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,100
Oh, what's this? Is this your diary?
Your little journal?

448
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,900
- Give me that. Don't touch that.
- You want this? Get it!

449
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,900
Come on, get it! Get it! Come on!
Come on! Yeah, yeah!

450
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:36,300
Oh, yeah, come on! Get it!
Get it!
Give it to me!

451
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,100
You're like a little birdie up there!

452
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,100
I will kill you.
You better give me that book.

453
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,900
"Shrimp and pea risotto
with basil and mint."

454
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,900
- Are you a chef?
- None of your business. Give it back!

455
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,900
Looks like you're
Wolfgang Stuck right here.
Travis! Travis!

456
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,900
- Hey! I let you pee.
- Oh, yeah, you did. You did.

457
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,000
Thank you so much.
Do you have to pee?

458
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,100
Well, you got 30 seconds.
Go ahead and pee.

459
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Oh, shit.

460
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,400
- Hey, I was kidding about what I said.
- Give me the book.

461
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,300
- I don't want it. I don't want it.
- Turn around.

462
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,100
- Why you always gotta hit me?
- Now listen to me.

463
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:23,900
We gotta get to this tree.
Let's go back to back.
All right. Okay.

464
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,300
- Kick your legs!
- I'm trying! I'm kicking my legs!

465
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,100
- Where are you?
- Grab me. Grab my back, not my ass.

466
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,700
- Got it?
- I got it. Got it.
Oh, great! You did it!

467
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,200
- Now what?
- Put your arm over me. Get to the tree.

468
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,600
- Listen.
- You're like Joe Pig-snare?
Put your arm over me!

469
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,100
- Just stop moving!
- The vine. You gotta grab the...

470
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,600
What was that?

471
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,400
- Oh, shit.
- What was that?

472
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,000
Monkeys.

473
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,900
Steady.

474
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,500
Steady.

475
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,300
Steady.

476
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,600
Steady.

477
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,900
Steady!

478
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
Oh, God!

479
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,300
Oh, God!

480
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,500
Do not fight them!

481
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,600
Oh, my God!

482
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,400
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- He's humping you, he's humping you!

483
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:47,500
- What's he doing?
- Establish dominance!
Establish dominance!

484
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,000
Get him off of me!

485
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,100
He's humping me!
Make him stop!

486
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,400
The ears! Get the ears.

487
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,100
- Who's that?
- It's the rebels.
Don't worry, they're my friends.

488
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,700
God bless you!

489
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,500
Say hi.

490
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,200
Hi.

491
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:41,600
These are your friends, huh?
What, are you kidding me?

492
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm starting to long for a monkey
with a hard-on.

493
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,200
Whatever happens,
just keep looking into his eyes.

494
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,700
- Won't that offend him?
- No.

495
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,200
Whatever you do, do not blink.
They're like grizzlies.

496
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,200
Just shut up
and let me take care of this.

497
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:11,400
We know you work for Hatcher.
Were you tracking us?!

498
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,600
- He thinks we work for Hatcher.
- Well, tell him the truth.

499
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,000
Fierce gaze. Fierce gaze.
Fierce gaze.

500
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Honorable host, unlike this man on my
left, I do not work for that evil scum.

501
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,800
Why does the giant stare at me without
respect? I will cut out his arrogant eyes!

502
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,300
- What's he saying?
- Shut up. Just hold his gaze.

503
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:48,000
He is Hatcher's assassin. Paid to hunt
all who oppose him, including me.

504
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,200
Why do I get the feeling
you really suck at Portuguese?

505
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,300
What did he say?!

506
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:06,000
He says he pisses on your ancestors...
...and that you would make
a very pretty bride!

507
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,500
- What's going on?
- He wants to fight you.

508
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,200
No. We're not fighting.
Tell him I don't want to fight.

509
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,200
The assassin is a great warrior! Better
to shoot him now and get it over with!

510
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,400
- We are not fighting.
- Don't worry, they're little people.

511
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,700
- What?
- You could take them. They're little.

512
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,700
You can win.

513
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,600
Why do you want to fight? Why?

514
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,200
I just want to get back to the airport.
Please. I just have to get home.

515
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:41,600
Okay, hip-hop.

516
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,900
I don't want to do this.
Please. Please.

517
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:58,000
Travis, tell them one more time
I do not want to fight.

518
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,400
I'd love to help you out,
buddy, but I don't think...

519
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,400
...they're really listening
to me anymore.

520
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,300
Heads up.

521
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,700
That's okay! That is okay!

522
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,000
Hey, Kansas Cities!

523
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,100
Don't do it.

524
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,200
What is that?
It's like spinning Tarzan jujitsu!

525
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,600
Speedy little bastards, aren't they?

526
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,500
Head's gotta stay up.

527
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,900
I am not your enemy.

528
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,200
Mariana?

529
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,800
What are you doing here?

530
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,200
Barmaid by day,
rebel leader by night.

531
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,100
You are good! The whole time I was
working you, you were working me.

532
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,900
I was hoping you might find
O Gato do Diabo.
It couldn't have all been work.

533
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Could it?
Man, that was some good work.

534
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,400
What do you think, Travis?

535
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,400
I knew. You know that, right?
I totally knew.
Of course.

536
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey.

537
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,600
The herbs will keep it
from getting infected.

538
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,600
- Why do you do this?
- Pardon me?

539
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,400
- Why do you fight?
- Because of 65 cents an hour.

540
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:23,100
That's what Hatcher
pays the workers.

541
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,400
But in order to mine,
you need tools.

542
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:29,100
You need food, clothing,
a place to sleep.

543
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,600
You have no money,
so, what do you do?

544
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,600
You borrow from Hatcher.

545
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:38,600
Pick and shovel, a dollar a day.

546
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,400
A sack to haul the dirt,
another dollar.

547
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:45,000
Old Mr. Beck knows a lot
about debt, don't you?

548
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,600
He knows what it's like to dig a hole
so deep you can't climb out.

549
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
Call it what you want.
It's escravidâo,

550
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,100
"Slavery."

551
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,300
And we intend to stop it.

552
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:08,800
Manito wants to know who would win
a fight between Tyson and Ali.

553
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,200
Ali, hands down.

554
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:18,100
He says, "What about
Tyson's power?"

555
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,400
Shit. Tell him Ali
would've done to Tyson...
...what he did to Foreman in Africa.

556
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,900
Rumble. Rumble in the Jungle,

557
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,100
Tell him Ali was too smart.

558
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,200
Too smart, too fast.
Would've used his jabs. Bam, bam!

559
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,000
Would've danced.

560
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,800
Would've played with his mind.

561
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,100
Before you know it, bam! Left
to the body. Bam! Right to the head.

562
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,600
Down goes Tyson.

563
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,600
Float like butterfly.

564
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,400
Sting like bee.

565
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,100
Float like butterfly, sting like bee.

566
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,700
- Yeah!
- Float like butterfly, sting like a bee!

567
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,000
- Yeah!
- Float like butterfly, sting like a bee!

568
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,100
He says he thinks
you are a great fighter...

569
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,000
...and he wants you to have it.
- It's for luck.
- Tell him I'm sorry, I can't.

570
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,300
You'll offend him if you refuse.

571
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,600
I'm honored. Thank you.

572
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:48,400
You'll need all the luck you can get.
It's a long walk back to the airfield.

573
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,800
Especially by yourself.

574
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,900
Nice!

575
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,900
You don't understand.

576
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:00,600
- I'm not going back without him.
- Oh, here we go again.
Fifty rifles say you are.

577
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,700
And we're rebels, not thieves.

578
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,800
Hatcher!

579
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,400
Travis!

580
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,100
Let's clean it up.

581
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,900
Not so fast, jungle boy.

582
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,100
Move! Move!

583
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,200
Come on!

584
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,700
Manito!

585
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,300
Go, go, go!

586
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,300
- Manito!
- Let's go!

587
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,000
I want hunting parties.

588
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,900
Small ones.

589
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,800
Find them.

590
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,900
Find them!

591
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,600
All right, this is the way
it's going to be.

592
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,200
You're going to take me
to O Gato do Diabo.

593
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:28,300
- And you're going to take me now.
- Calm down.

594
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,300
Don't! You saw what they do.
Don't ever tell me to calm down.

595
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,900
Travis, don't play with me.

596
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,400
- Or what?
- Or I'm going to shoot you.

597
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,500
Well, if you shoot me,
you're never gonna find the Gato.

598
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,400
- So we're gonna make a little deal.
- Deal?

599
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,200
You see? O Gato is an object to you.
It's life on the Riviera, a private yacht.

600
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,900
- You don't know anything about me.
- For us it's hope.

601
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,300
My heart's breaking.
It's like a telethon.

602
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,700
- You selfish...
- Enough!

603
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,700
Sit down! Sit down!

604
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,300
Holy shit, you tried to shoot me!

605
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,100
You saw it!

606
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,700
- Crazy.
- Shut up.
Shut up.

607
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,900
The deal's this.
He takes you to the Gato.

608
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,600
You just show me how I get out of this
jungle so I can take him home. Deal?

609
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,700
Do we have a deal?

610
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,200
- Deal.
- Let me get this straight.

611
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,600
She gets what she needs,
you get what you need...

612
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,000
...and I get the shaft.
- I could always give her back the gun.

613
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,800
- I really don't like you.
- Yeah, well, I get that a lot.

614
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,300
Seriously.

615
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,500
What?

616
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:46,800
I was just wondering
how it is you came to do...

617
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,300
...you know, whatever it is you do.

618
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,100
- It's a long story.
- It's a long walk.

619
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:58,500
I grew up in a very rough place.

620
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,000
One thing led to another, that's all.

621
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,400
- Just like you.
- Like me?

622
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Yeah, you get pushed,
you push back.

623
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:10,200
Well, with me, I pushed so hard
that word got around.

624
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:15,000
Before I knew it, I was in a room
full of the wrong people...
...with the wrong money.

625
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:21,200
So you think I'm standing
in a room full of the wrong people?
Yeah. Something like that.

626
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:24,100
I like you, Mr. Beck.

627
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,200
Really.

628
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,500
But you and I are nothing alike.

629
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,100
Travis!

630
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,400
Let's keep moving. Let's go.

631
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,500
What are you doing?

632
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:22,400
Let's take us a little swim,
Wolfgang.

633
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,900
We're not swimming. Let's go.
Come on, big boy.
You could use a bath.

634
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,300
Travis, we have to keep moving.
It'll be dark soon.

635
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,300
Why?

636
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
We're already here.

637
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,000
- Don't pee in the water.
- Why?

638
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:56,400
A candiru, a vicious parasite,
will swim up the urine into your pau.

639
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,600
Come on, big boy! It feels good!

640
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,800
- Swim up my what?
- Your pinto.

641
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,900
It'll swim up your ding-dong. And once
it gets in, you can't get it out.

642
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,400
Come on!

643
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,200
Wait.

644
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,600
Well, then what?

645
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,800
They have to amputate.

646
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,600
Not this boy's pinto, Not today.

647
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:58,000
The hieroglyphic code...

648
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,600
...said the great chief of the Marajó
people put the Gato to sleep...

649
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,300
...behind walls of a moving curtain.
- A waterfall.

650
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,200
Must be some kind of
methane buildup.

651
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,700
It's cool. Let's go.

652
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,400
- Oh, God!
- Yeah, real genius.

653
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:54,200
- You have no clue what you're doing.
- Oh, shut up!

654
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,300
You obviously don't know
anything about methane deposits.

655
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,200
- Oh, and you do?
- Shut up.

656
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,700
What'd you just say?

657
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,500
What is it?

658
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,000
Why do I get the feeling
we are not supposed to be here?

659
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,300
Because we're not.

660
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,300
There it is! I told you it was real!

661
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,400
Travis, you're never gonna get
back there. It's too dangerous.

662
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:11,800
The roof is coming down!
Wait a second.

663
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,500
A jaguar.

664
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,700
I know what this is.
Monkey.

665
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,900
Eagle.

666
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,700
- I can't hold this, Travis.
- I know what this is.

667
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,300
- What is it?
- It's an 800-year-old safe.

668
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,700
This is how they kept
their treasures protected.

669
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:35,800
There's a combination.

670
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,200
Jaguar, cat. Gato, cat.
It's gotta be the jaguar.

671
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,600
We pull the sticks closest
to the jaguar, we'll be okay.

672
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,900
For 60 seconds,
then the roof's coming down.

673
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,000
You're not gonna touch anything.
Let's go!

674
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,700
All right.

675
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,800
Follow the jag.

676
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,800
Follow the jaguar.

677
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,200
Easy. Easy.

678
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:14,100
It's coming down, Travis.

679
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,400
What are you doing?
Let's go!

680
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,600
Pass it to me.

681
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,400
- Is that a jaguar?
- I think it's an eagle!
Travis, hurry!

682
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,300
Oh, my...

683
01:04:45,300 --> 01:04:47,700
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

684
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,900
I did it.

685
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,200
I found you.

686
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:03,600
Not some Oxford archaeologist
or some stiff-ass Harvard professor.

687
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:06,800
- I did it! I found you!
- Who gives a shit?

688
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,100
How you like me now, huh, Beck?

689
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,800
Go! Go! Move! Now!

690
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,700
Run!

691
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:20,300
Let's go!

692
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,700
Move!

693
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,900
These are konlabos.

694
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,300
They're very rare.

695
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,800
You're lucky.

696
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,200
And I wouldn't flirt with O Gato
do Diabo's eyes if I were you.

697
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,900
- They say it's dangerous.
- What else do they say?

698
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:58,800
Once restored to its rightful owners,
the rivers will be laden with fish.

699
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:01,900
And the trees will grow tall,
bringing shade for hammocks...

700
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,700
...so its people may rest their backs.
You think bringing this Gato
will do all that?

701
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:10,700
No, Mr. Beck. But I expect the money
selling it brings will do just that.

702
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:14,700
We can buy seed, irrigate.
Farm our own lands.

703
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,400
Free ourselves from Hatcher's mine.

704
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,100
When that statue hits the black
market, it'll vanish forever.

705
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,900
It's a little late for morals.
Especially after you were going
to do the same thing.

706
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,100
And 10 percent of that is going
to pay for your freedom...

707
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,700
...so I'd be a little more grateful
if I were you.

708
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:37,900
What if I told you I was gonna
give it to a museum...

709
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,100
...so the whole world
could appreciate it?

710
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,800
You can tell me anything you want,
Travis, but I know you.

711
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:53,200
What are you going to do
after you bring him home?

712
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,100
- I'm gonna open a restaurant.
- Yeah. He's a killer in the kitchen too.

713
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,700
Ten, 15 tables. Nothing fancy.

714
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,800
Italian. Southern Italian.

715
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,400
How do you...?

716
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,500
How do you...? How do you spell...

717
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
,,, konlabos?

718
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,800
Konlabos, with a K.

719
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,400
Don't worry. After four or five hours,
you'll be as good as new.

720
01:07:48,700 --> 01:07:51,900
The fire will keep the animals away
until sunup.

721
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,800
I'm sorry...

722
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
...but money has a way
of changing people.

723
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,700
You did find it, Travis.

724
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,200
Just like you said.

725
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,100
No one can take that
away from you.

726
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:19,500
And I will send you the money...
...buy your freedom. I meant that.

727
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:26,100
You kept your word,
and I admire that...

728
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:28,400
...so I'll keep mine.

729
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,600
Go north until you reach
the Quantana Road.

730
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:35,500
Take it south
all the way to the airfield.
Good luck to you, Mr. Beck.

731
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,100
Oh, shit.

732
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,800
What? What?

733
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,900
- What?
- Monkey. Monkey.

734
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,200
Monkey? Where?
Just get him away from me.

735
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,900
- Get out of here.
- Get out of here.

736
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Get out of here, monkey!

737
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,200
Oh, no.

738
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,400
- I hate this place.
- Get out of here!

739
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,900
I hate penis-eating minnows,
and I hate freaky fruit.

740
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,400
- Get them away from me.
- I wanna go home. I want concrete.

741
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:17,100
- Get out of here, monkey.
- I want homemade tortellini.

742
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,500
I want my Los Angeles Lakers.

743
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:23,500
That's what I want. I want to go home.
I want to go home.

744
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,300
I want to go home!

745
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:31,600
Get out of here, monkey.
Get out of here, monkey.

746
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:52,700
Well, what about that?

747
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,600
- Been for a stroll, have you, boys?
- Where's my bag?
Where's my jeep?

748
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,600
Give me my bag.

749
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,000
You have any water?

750
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:26,500
Sit down. How soon
before we can take off?

751
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,300
You left a jeep at the bottom
of a mountainside.

752
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:32,000
- I'll take care of it.
- In a bloody large puddle.

753
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,100
- I said, I'll take care of it.
- That jeep is dead, my friend.

754
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:40,300
Look, you'll get your money.
- Just start the plane.
- What's your big hurry?

755
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:43,800
I'm trying to leave before I run
into Hatcher or more problems.

756
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:49,100
Don't go worrying about Hatcher.
That monstrosity
won't give a flying fornication...

757
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:54,000
...for the pair of youse no more.
He got what he was after.
What do you mean?

758
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:59,000
He caught up with poor Mariana
in the jungle.
He relieved her of her artifact.

759
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,200
- What'd you say?
- I said, he relieved her of her artifact.

760
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,500
It's a word in the English language.
"Artifact." Look it up.

761
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,000
Son of a bitch. He's got my Gato!

762
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,100
- Your what?
- The Gato. Don't you speak English?

763
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,600
- Hey. Where is she?
- Hatcher's got her in town.

764
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:22,500
- He's torturing her for information.
- He's doing what?

765
01:12:23,700 --> 01:12:29,200
Freedom fighters?
Freedom fighters, my ass.
Lutadores de Louco, you ask me.

766
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:31,500
They're all gonna die.

767
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,700
Come on. All aboard.

768
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,400
Come on.

769
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,100
What are you doing?

770
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,100
- We made a deal.
- A deal?

771
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:20,700
What the hell does that mean?
I'm here at the airstrip,
she doesn't have the Gato.

772
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:23,400
Gonna go in there by yourself?

773
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,300
No way. No way.

774
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,600
Hey, Hatcher's got a small army
back there.

775
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:33,500
You don't know your way
around the town.
Oh, wait. I got an idea.

776
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,700
Saddle up to one of those bulls...

777
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:40,400
...ride into town like a conquistador
and challenge all of them to a duel.

778
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:43,600
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

779
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,800
You don't use guns.

780
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,500
- What's your point?
- You're gonna die, Beck.

781
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:53,100
The boy's right.
You mind if we settle the bill now?
You need help.

782
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Are you gonna help me, Travis?
All you care about is the money.
No, Beck, you're wrong.

783
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,600
I'd rather die than let that
son of a bitch get my Gato.

784
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,600
You need all the help you can get.
You can even use him, for chrissake.

785
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,900
Don't bring me into it.
I got a dodgy knee here.

786
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,900
You can't do this on your own.

787
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:23,900
Okay, Travis.

788
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,500
I know you're gonna run on me.

789
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:33,400
Might not be tonight or tomorrow.
But I will find you,
and I will take you back.

790
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,600
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

791
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:40,800
We'll both probably be dead
in about an hour.

792
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:43,000
So let's cancel Christmas.

793
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,700
Your plan of attack was a bit naive.

794
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:59,700
Man, if I was only
10 minutes younger, huh?

795
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:04,000
I suppose now we have a conversation
where you enlighten me.

796
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,500
Mr. Hatcher.

797
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:08,700
How many more of you are out there?
Enlighten me.

798
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:12,700
Where are the rest of your
compadres? Enlighten me!
Mr. Hatcher.

799
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,100
I don't get why you people
are so hostile.

800
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:19,200
I've been good to you.
I built you a town.
Why are we fighting?

801
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,700
- Mr. Hatcher.
- What?

802
01:15:20,900 --> 01:15:23,800
We've lost contact
with Outpost 1.

803
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,900
There's nobody answering.

804
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,400
- Mr, Hatcher, are you out there?
- What can I do for you, Mr. Beck?

805
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,900
I have no desire to fight
with you or your men,

806
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:41,300
For that reason,
you have two options,

807
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,600
Option A, you leave the Gato
and the girl,,,

808
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,300
,,, and you walk out of town,
no questions asked,

809
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,600
- What's option B?
- Option B,,,

810
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,500
,,, I make you,

811
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,100
Wrong choice,

812
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:15,400
Lock down the town.

813
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:23,200
Still no visual contact, Team two
is checking the perimeter right now,

814
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:09,300
He...

815
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:13,000
...that heard the sound
of thy holy trumpet...

816
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,300
...and took not warning...

817
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:19,400
...he hath clearly wandered too far...

818
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,500
...from the word of God.
And Cornelius Bernard Hatcher...

819
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:29,500
,,, your heir has come,
Let's get it on, big boy!

820
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:33,200
It's time to get back on the path.

821
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,900
That's a lot of cows.

822
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:43,500
Hi.

823
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,800
What nerve.

824
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,100
About bloody time, huh?

825
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,600
Somebody just shoot him.

826
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,500
Oh, yeah? Oh, you want one?

827
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,200
Oh, okay.

828
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:11,200
A little thunder? Huh?
You like thunderstorms, big boy?

829
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
How about some lightning?

830
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:27,300
Ear, ear... Ears, eyes, foot, face!

831
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,400
Take the Gato and the girl
and get to the airfield.

832
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:40,400
If you run into trouble,
use her as a hostage.

833
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:46,200
And Harvey,
when you're safely out of town...
...put her out of my misery.

834
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,000
I need help!

835
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,500
Do not go gentle
into that good night, my lovely.

836
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,400
Beck! I need help. Beck!

837
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:42,400
Rage, rage...

838
01:22:44,900 --> 01:22:47,400
...against the dying of the light.

839
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:53,100
There shall be no mercy...

840
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,700
...for any force that stands...

841
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,800
...blocking this path
of his righteousness.

842
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:10,700
Beck, help!

843
01:23:18,700 --> 01:23:21,100
Help!

844
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,900
Move!

845
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,000
No way.

846
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:00,200
Give me back my Gato,
you little bald freak!

847
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,800
Oh, great.

848
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:45,700
See you.

849
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,900
You got the moves.

850
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,800
I'll give you that.

851
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,800
You reached into the wrong
refrigerator, Mr. Beck.

852
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,500
Hold your horses.

853
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,600
What have I done?

854
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:22,000
Are we not men?

855
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:24,600
- Hatcher.
- What?

856
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,600
Option A is still on the table.
You can walk away right now.

857
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:32,200
Option A doesn't work for me.

858
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:37,200
Before I came here,
what did you people have?

859
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,200
Face it. Be fair.

860
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,200
I put a roof over your head,
coin in your pockets.

861
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,400
You barefoot Indians
didn't have pockets...

862
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:50,000
...before Hatcher came along.

863
01:28:50,300 --> 01:28:53,900
I gave you a life!
I'm the heart in the darkness.

864
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:55,700
Face it...

865
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,600
...you can't run this thing
without me.

866
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:02,500
I am pumping the blood
of the modern world...

867
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,900
...into your backward veins...

868
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,100
...you stinking...

869
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:10,600
...ingrate...

870
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,200
...Oompa Loompa...

871
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:16,600
...morons!

872
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,100
Okay.

873
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,300
That's it, I'm done.

874
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,800
Mr. Beck...

875
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:38,500
...I'll take option A.

876
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,700
Clear, please.

877
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,700
Oh, shit.

878
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:27,100
You make a hell of an entrance,
Mr. Beck.

879
01:30:28,900 --> 01:30:30,500
Yeah.

880
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,400
I'd offer you a beer,
but I think you blew up my bar.

881
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:42,200
Yeah, I think you're right.

882
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,900
Thank you.

883
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,600
- We had a deal.
- Yes, we did.

884
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And I'm afraid I didn't deliver
on that deal.

885
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:56,300
How is that?

886
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:00,100
The Gato.

887
01:31:00,200 --> 01:31:02,500
I promised you the Gato.

888
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,900
Yes, well, I promised you Travis.

889
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:09,000
You all talking about this Travis?

890
01:31:09,900 --> 01:31:11,900
And this Gato?

891
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,800
I'm impressed.
Yeah, well, make sure
they spell my name right.

892
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:33,100
I told you it wasn't about the money.

893
01:31:35,200 --> 01:31:36,900
Well, big boy...

894
01:31:37,100 --> 01:31:39,200
...I guess it's your move.

895
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:52,400
I'm impressed myself, Travis.

896
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:59,800
Declan, start the plane.

897
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:03,700
"Declan, start the plane"?
What does that mean?

898
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:07,900
- I'm taking you home.
- Oh, I figured that.
No breaks. Good luck.

899
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,700
You too.

900
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,900
I will send you your cut.

901
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,500
Move.

902
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:20,400
- Not a penny less than 15.6 million.
- Move, Travis.

903
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,600
You really ought
to stay away from guns.

904
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,400
You ought to get yourself
a psychiatrist. Seriously.

905
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,700
Move.

906
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,300
Well, look at him.

907
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:30,900
Look at you. Your beard.
You're like a real man.

908
01:33:31,100 --> 01:33:33,500
- But you're so thin.
- Running is good exercise.

909
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:37,700
Good exercise. That's funny.
Did you hear him?
Running for your life.

910
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,900
I love it. I really do!

911
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,300
You know there's not
enough aspirin in the world...

912
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:49,200
...for a headache like you?
- Well, there probably is.

913
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,000
- But I understand what you mean.
- Well, that's good.

914
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:56,300
Because that means you'll understand
why you'll take that trip to Chicago.

915
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:59,100
Actually, I don't completely
understand that one.

916
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,500
- Still the smart-ass.
- I'm not that smart, Dad.

917
01:34:02,500 --> 01:34:05,700
- I didn't know she was married.
- Well, she was.

918
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,300
Very married.

919
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,100
And you. What took you
so long, huh?

920
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,900
Your kid was
a tough rundown, Billy.

921
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,500
- Him? No.
- Yeah, yeah.

922
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:21,000
But I did walk him right through
that door, right? Like we agreed?

923
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,000
- You did.
- We good?

924
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:27,300
We're good.
Two hundred and fifty large.

925
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,800
You got your restaurant, kid.

926
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:31,900
Now get out of here, huh?

927
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:38,500
Before I leave...
When I was in Brazil, they
showed me this ritual they do...

928
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:40,400
...when they have big celebrations.

929
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:46,500
What they do is, they eat this fruit,
and it's called konlabos, with a K.

930
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:52,500
So I figured before I leave,
we could celebrate one last time.

931
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,500
Come on, guys. Try some of this.

932
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:57,900
If he says it's good, it's gotta be.
He's the best chef I know.

933
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,800
Billy, here, you try the first piece.

934
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,200
Not bad.

935
01:35:03,700 --> 01:35:07,100
Big seeds, though.
I don't like seeds.

936
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,400
Hey, what are you...?

937
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:33,500
I walked him right through
that door, Billy.

938
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:39,900
Boy...

939
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:44,100
...you got a funny-Iooking face.

940
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,000
Hey, Dad.

941
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:49,600
I love you, you know that?

942
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,400
I love you, you know that?
Because you showed me
something back there.

943
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:57,300
I thought you had character,
but I wasn't sure.

944
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:00,100
- You got it, man. You really got it!
- Get in the truck.

945
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:04,200
- You violated every agricultural law.
- That's the least of my problems.

946
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:08,500
We should go back
in there and finish him off.
You want to go back, go ahead.

947
01:36:08,700 --> 01:36:11,900
- Knock yourself out. I'll wait for you.
- I'm not going back.

948
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Right. So shut up, get in the truck
before I change my mind.

949
01:36:16,200 --> 01:36:17,700
Don't push me.

950
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,500
- What?
- Don't push me.
I appreciate everything you did.

951
01:36:22,700 --> 01:36:26,800
If you want to get technical, all you did
is even the score. I saved you first.

952
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,900
- Get in.
- You don't have to thank me.

953
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:32,700
But this pushing shit ain't
happening no more. You read me?

954
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:39,600
Okay. I'm gonna bust you up.

955
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,700
Go for it.

956
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:44,800
Yeah.

957
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:49,900
Hey, remember your friend
Mr. Thunder?

958
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:52,600
How about his buddy
Mr. Lightning?

959
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:56,300
I know you know him.

960
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:59,300
You know him real well, don't you?

961
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,800
I'm just playing, man.
I'll be in the truck.

962
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,700
I'm gonna kill you.

963
01:37:20,700 --> 01:37:30,700
