1
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,197
Excuse me.

2
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,448
Shithead.

3
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,467
You shouldn't be here.

4
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:57,970
l know. Ask for
at least §1,000, okay?

5
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,973
l'll get as much
as l can. You hide.

6
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,934
His wife took his kid
and a couple of million...

7
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,936
and we won't
get a thousand.

8
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,437
Shut up
and stay hidden.

9
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,023
l told him
l was coming alone.

10
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,037
Hey, Mr. Crisp.

11
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,706
How's it going?

12
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,667
You said you had information
about my family.

13
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,878
Yeah, yeah, l do.

14
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:17,382
Well, let's have it.

15
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,221
Well, it's going to cost you.

16
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,889
Like §1,000?

17
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,685
Okay, that's obviously
not my final offer.

18
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,229
750 would be fine.

19
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,524
l mean, more than fine.

20
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,109
Just tell me what
you have, Danny...

21
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,154
and l'll take
good care of you.

22
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:40,322
Okay.

23
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,823
That sounds fair.

24
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,701
l was doing a delivery
for Corky last week

25
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,036
out of state...

26
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,913
and l ran into your ex.

27
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,248
How'd she look?

28
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,084
She looked great,
Mr. Crisp. Yeah.

29
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,378
She changed her hair
and stuff...

30
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,214
but she looked like
a million dollars.

31
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,342
ln fact, she looked like
about §3 million.

32
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:03,220
Did she see you?

33
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,597
No. l was
changing a tire...

34
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,100
and suddenly, there she was
across the street...

35
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,060
taking her kid
into this school.

36
00:05:11,353 --> 00:05:12,771
My boy?

37
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:14,106
Looked great.

38
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,691
He looked very healthy.

39
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:19,111
lt's a real nice, healthy place
where they're living.

40
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,863
lt snows in winter there.

41
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:22,406
Danny...

42
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,784
where are they?

43
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,204
At the school
where l saw them--

44
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,623
Astoria Elementary School.

45
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,958
That's--

46
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,711
lt's in Astoria, Oregon.

47
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:37,880
All right.

48
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,299
Did you tell
anyone else this?

49
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,341
No.

50
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,551
No way.

51
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,803
Hey, l'm not stupid,
Mr. Crisp.

52
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,807
You're not?

53
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,408
Danny.

54
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,243
Danny! No!

55
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,329
Danny!

56
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,123
Danny!

57
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,416
Get up!

58
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:18,420
Don't you die on me!

59
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,090
l didn't kill him.
l didn't kill him.

60
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,634
Was it Crisp?

61
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:26,428
l don't know.
l didn't see anything.

62
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,597
What are you doing?

63
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,682
Hey, hey, hey!

64
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,226
Stop it! Don't do that!

65
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,769
Don't go anywhere.

66
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,103
Let me go!

67
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,980
No! Let me off of him!

68
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,107
l don't like
what you've done.

69
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:40,651
l really don't like it.

70
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,153
lt feels terrible,
and it looks dreadful.

71
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,655
l'm trying my best.

72
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,657
Maybe your best
isn't good enough.

73
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:47,783
l'm back.

74
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,660
Oh, great.
Well, that was fast.

75
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,286
lt was easy.

76
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,830
l have some great, exciting,
wonderful news, Mother.

77
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,832
Oh, you always
exaggerate, Cullen.

78
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,835
Everything is always
great, terrific.

79
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,837
So, what's so great?

80
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,381
l just found out
where they're hiding.

81
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:05,425
Are you serious?
You really know where he is?

82
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,553
Manicure, Mr. Crisp?

83
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,556
Oh, how could l
say no to you?

84
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,807
Tell me.

85
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,225
What's happened?

86
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,144
Just let me
handle this myself, Mother.

87
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:18,063
l know what l'm doing.

88
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,731
Everything is under control.

89
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,117
lt's all right.
l'm a police officer.

90
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,660
Crisp, you're under arrest.

91
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:33,245
Put your hands on your head

92
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,830
and get up!

93
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:36,331
Kimble, not again!

94
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:37,332
Your hands!

95
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,375
They're up.

96
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,210
When will you
leave me alone?

97
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,546
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

98
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,173
Hey, l'm a police officer.

99
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,674
This is an arrest.

100
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,759
This man's crazy.
Look at him.

101
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,387
He'll kill me.
You're just going to stand there?

102
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,264
Freeze!

103
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,515
l'm a cop!

104
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,559
l'm Detective John Kimble.

105
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,019
This man is under arrest.

106
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,061
l'm checking.

107
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,022
You can't just walk in here

108
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,566
and put a gun in my face.

109
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,443
l'm trying to get a manicure.

110
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,986
l have witnesses.

111
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,447
l have a witness, too.

112
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,033
lt's murder one this time.

113
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,367
Now you're mine.

114
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:16,955
The bastard handcuffed me
to a dead man!

115
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,373
A dead man!

116
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,875
Come on. Sit down.

117
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,793
Now, did Danny ever say

118
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,754
what Crisp's wife looked like?

119
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,339
No.

120
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,592
Did he ever say what name
she was using in Oregon?

121
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,135
He didn't say anything.

122
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,638
Look, l just
want to go home.

123
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,098
After the lineup,
l'll drive you home.

124
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,600
l'll even buy you dinner.

125
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,101
l'll even cook you dinner.

126
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,103
l'm not doing any lineup...

127
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,565
and there ain't jack shit
you can do about it!

128
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:46,151
l've been after Crisp
for four years...

129
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,612
and she's letting
my key witness walk away?

130
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,947
Kimble, sit down!

131
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,989
Sit down.

132
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,241
- Sit.
- Sit.

133
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,494
Now listen to me.

134
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,995
He killed your boyfriend.

135
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,498
All you have to do
is point your finger...

136
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,501
and we can put him away
for 30 years.

137
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,838
He wasn't my boyfriend.
l hardly knew the guy.

138
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,093
l know you're in there.

139
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,596
l know what you want,
but you ain't getting it.

140
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,849
No lineup, no testimony.

141
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,017
So shove your handcuffs
up your ass!

142
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,353
Now let me out of here!

143
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:22,521
Slow down!

144
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,606
Open it and let me out!

145
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:31,280
O'Hara, meet Kimble.

146
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,283
Kimble's been on this
a long time.

147
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,284
Hi.

148
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,286
Let me take care of Cindy.

149
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,329
She'll make Crisp.
l guarantee it.

150
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,789
What are you going to do...

151
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:42,291
handcuff her to your car

152
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,293
and take her for a ride?

153
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,962
l'm not going to offer
to cook her dinner.

154
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,881
Kimble, hold on a second. l--

155
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:51,717
Difficult man.
Got to get to know him.

156
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,302
Oh, l can't wait.

157
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,202
Hey, baby.

158
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,245
What you mean, ''Hey, baby''?

159
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,335
¿Dònde vas?

160
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,256
Shit!

161
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:33,842
Oh, excuse me.

162
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:36,386
l forgot to introduce myself.

163
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,849
My name is John Kimble...

164
00:10:40,933 --> 00:10:42,893
and l love my car.

165
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:45,187
l'll keep an eye
on it for you.

166
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:47,689
You got a beautiful ride.

167
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,234
Shit. Who does
he think he is?

168
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,070
He's lucky l didn't
kick his ass.

169
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:26,436
Open up.

170
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,564
You can't come in.

171
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,737
Thank you.

172
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,823
What the fuck?

173
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,381
All right...

174
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,674
party's over.

175
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,593
Everyone go home.

176
00:11:59,887 --> 00:12:01,847
Next time, my place.

177
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,183
So who are you, man?

178
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:05,350
Shit!

179
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,770
l'm the party-pooper.

180
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,900
Hi, Cindy.

181
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:17,988
Do you mind if l sit down?

182
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,198
No.

183
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:21,450
Sit down, man.

184
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,163
Oh, it's so nice
to see you again.

185
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,166
What are you doing here,
you asshole?

186
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,127
Cindy, l don't like you
using foul language...

187
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,671
not a classy girl
like you.

188
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,674
Don't you have
anything better to do?

189
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,134
You don't understand.

190
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,470
l have nothing else to do...

191
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:44,348
and l have nowhere else to go.

192
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,976
Why are you staring
at me like that?

193
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,645
l like you, Cindy.

194
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,648
l'm going to be
around you a lot--

195
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,816
days, nights,
weekends, holidays.

196
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,984
No.

197
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,528
No, you can't.

198
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,029
Yes, l can.

199
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,032
l'm going to
hang out with you

200
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,076
until the end of time.

201
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,621
All right, move it in. Let's go.

202
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,706
Step onto the numbers.

203
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,167
Face front.

204
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:16,755
Everybody, hands to your side.

205
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,507
That's the creep.

206
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,675
Who?

207
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,385
Number five.

208
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,970
That's him.

209
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,558
Good.

210
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,559
Very good.

211
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,604
Mr. Crisp, you will be
remanded into custody

212
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:34,106
until your trial.

213
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,941
Bailiff, remove the prisoner.

214
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,484
Shh. Don't say anything.

215
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:38,944
Just take it easy.

216
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,572
l'll take care of it.
Trust me.

217
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:47,953
You know what to do?

218
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:50,539
l'm your mother, aren't l?

219
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:02,176
Mind if l talk
to my friend a little bit?

220
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,469
l'm not talking to anybody
without my lawyer.

221
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,054
He's right in here.

222
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,729
You give me the names

223
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,731
of your drug suppliers
and distributors...

224
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,232
and l'll tell the judge

225
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,735
what a nice, cooperative killer
you are.

226
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,613
You think the jury's
going to convict me

227
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,115
on the testimony
of that junkie?

228
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,159
You could be right.

229
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:34,416
But what about your wife?

230
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:35,959
You remember her?

231
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,420
All that hard-earned drug money

232
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:40,005
she stole from you?

233
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:42,007
How much was it...

234
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,759
§3 million?

235
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,179
l bet she would make
a much better witness.

236
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:49,640
Kimble, you've wasted years
chasing after me...

237
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,683
and what has it
gotten you, hmm?

238
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:52,684
Nothing.

239
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,645
l'll be out in a week...

240
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,189
and you'll still be
eating take-out food

241
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:59,107
in that dump you live in.

242
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:02,152
Yeah, l know all
about you, Kimble.

243
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,280
Without me, you wouldn't
even have a life.

244
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:08,116
My old lady left
'cause of the money.

245
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,788
Yours left because she just
couldn't stand the sight of you.

246
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,416
l've never seen anyone
so little

247
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,876
eat so much.

248
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,419
Yeah, l know.
l'm hypoglycemic.

249
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:20,963
lf l don't eat regularly...

250
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,965
l get a little nuts.

251
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,967
So... where you from?

252
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:25,884
Austria.

253
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:28,887
How long you been a cop?

254
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,390
l been a cop for 12 years.

255
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,891
My father was a cop...

256
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:34,393
my brother was a cop...

257
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:36,395
my mother was a cop's wife.

258
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
And l have no hobbies.

259
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,693
You two are booked on the first
flight to Portland tomorrow.

260
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:45,696
Locate Crisp's wife
and offer her immunity

261
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,240
in exchange for
her testimony against him.

262
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,700
No offense to O'Hallahan...

263
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:54,204
but this is my case,
and l work alone.

264
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,248
He works alone.

265
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,249
Not anymore.

266
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,750
She's going in undercover

267
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,378
as a substitute
kindergarten teacher.

268
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,839
Not exactly a job for you.

269
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,883
l used to be a teacher.

270
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:07,342
We'll be fine.

271
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:08,886
What do l do?

272
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,095
She locates the kid...

273
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,598
you find the mother
and the cash...

274
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,100
and Crisp spends his life
making license plates.

275
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,351
Bon voyage.

276
00:16:16,393 --> 00:16:19,855
Oh, and, Kimble,
the name's O'Hara.

277
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,778
OK. Here's the wife at 17.

278
00:16:26,862 --> 00:16:28,780
Real name's Rachel Myatt.

279
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:31,283
She's from Hannibal, Missouri,
class of '76.

280
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,451
Cheerleader, first violin

281
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:33,744
in the school orchestra...

282
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,746
captain of the girls'
softball team.

283
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:38,790
Her ambition was ''To travel...

284
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:41,126
experience life...

285
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,586
and meet interesting people.''

286
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,546
Like Crisp.

287
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,631
Okay.

288
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,427
Relax.

289
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:52,471
Don't let him get to you.

290
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:56,141
That's her 10 years later.

291
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,644
lt's a great shot of an ear.

292
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,188
You get in touch
with her parents?

293
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,648
They're both dead.

294
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:05,484
The only relative
she's got left is the kid.

295
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,486
Hey.

296
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:14,868
Okay. This is the only picture
we have of him.

297
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:17,788
Cullen Jr., aged 3 months.

298
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:18,789
That helps much.

299
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:20,749
lt's the best l could do.

300
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:21,750
Breakfast, sir? Ma'am?

301
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:22,751
Please.

302
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:24,086
No. No, no.

303
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,420
That's a first.

304
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,508
Listen, l was
just thinking.

305
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,094
Maybe we should
take a wild stab

306
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,096
at getting to know each other

307
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,098
before we have to pretend
we're married.

308
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,100
What do you want to know?

309
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:40,143
How long have we been married?

310
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:41,645
A long time.

311
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,857
People won't expect us
to talk much to each other.

312
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,817
l want to read it, too.

313
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,776
Stop it.

314
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,194
Please?

315
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:50,779
Let me take a look.

316
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,282
Hey, come here.

317
00:17:53,365 --> 00:17:55,826
lf you don't stop
screwing around back there...

318
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,203
this is what
l'll do with you.

319
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,625
Ohh.

320
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,043
What's the matter?

321
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:06,378
l don't know.

322
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,547
l just don't feel so good.

323
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,798
You hungry?

324
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,634
l got to get out
of here right now.

325
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,512
Get those tree stumps
out of my way

326
00:18:15,596 --> 00:18:17,598
before l vomit all over them.

327
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,021
ls your wife okay, sir?

328
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,231
Compared to what?

329
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,157
Maybe it was the burrito.

330
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,785
Or it could've been the sausages.

331
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:41,330
l don't think it was
the crab salad.

332
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,332
lt couldn't
have been the doughnuts.

333
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,417
Excuse me.

334
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:49,755
Oh, l hate feeling like this.

335
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,548
l hate it, too.

336
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,052
Uh-oh.

337
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,595
Uh-oh what?

338
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,555
Uh-oh...

339
00:18:58,639 --> 00:18:59,640
pull over.

340
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:00,599
Now?

341
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,017
Yeah. Please hurry.

342
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,743
The key!

343
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,286
Give me the key!

344
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,983
Do you need a hand?

345
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:12,212
You okay?

346
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:13,380
l'm fine.

347
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,644
l'll be fine.

348
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:31,273
Class starts
at 9:00 in the morning.

349
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,816
l'll be fine.

350
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,776
You look much better already.

351
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,155
Oh. Kindergarten, 6-year-olds.

352
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:40,657
That's why l quit teaching,
you know.

353
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:44,620
l got so sick
of other people's kids.

354
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:48,290
l was afraid that
l'd never want to have any

355
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,875
of my own.

356
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:57,633
l have a son.

357
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,345
He's 13.

358
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,848
l remember
when he was 5.

359
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,809
He lives with his mother
and stepfather.

360
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,437
Aah!

361
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,397
What's the matter?

362
00:21:12,481 --> 00:21:13,398
What...

363
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,399
is...

364
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:15,817
that?

365
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:18,362
Oh, excuse me.
l forgot to tell you.

366
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:19,821
This is my ferret.

367
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:21,907
He doesn't bite.
Don't worry.

368
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,500
Come on.
Come on out.

369
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:34,586
This is all l need--
an obstacle.

370
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,255
A goddamn obstacle.

371
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,507
He sends me an obstacle.

372
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:39,591
Here.

373
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,777
Oh, God.

374
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:03,198
Don't worry.

375
00:22:03,282 --> 00:22:04,700
l'm going to make it.

376
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,120
l just need a minute.

377
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:11,123
l'll be ready
in just a minute.

378
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,708
l just got--

379
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:16,336
Oh, God.

380
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:25,137
How do l look?

381
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,727
Take off the gun.

382
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,439
That's a good idea.

383
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:42,779
The little bastards
are going to eat you alive.

384
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,408
Get some rest,
and don't worry.

385
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:49,453
l've been working undercover
for a long time.

386
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,954
They're 6-year-olds.

387
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,415
How much trouble
can they be?

388
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:56,251
On second thought...

389
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,962
take the gun.

390
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,367
Matthew...

391
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,869
l sent you to
the principal's office

392
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,412
because you punched Jenny.

393
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:35,541
l know. She poisoned
your hamsters.

394
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:37,543
She told me all about it...

395
00:23:37,626 --> 00:23:39,044
and she's very sorry.

396
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:42,631
And l'm sorry that
l didn't believe you.

397
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:47,135
- But you shouldn't punch people.
- But she--

398
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:50,013
Mr. Kimble, Miss Schlowski
will see you now.

399
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:52,891
Let's go back to class.

400
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,814
Can l help you?

401
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,984
l'm John Kimble,
your new kindergarten teacher.

402
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,738
We were expecting
a Miss O'Hara.

403
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,658
There's been
a change of plan.

404
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,328
Four weeks into
the new semester...

405
00:24:13,412 --> 00:24:17,374
my superintendent told me
l had to replace Mrs. Hagley...

406
00:24:17,457 --> 00:24:20,836
a kindergarten teacher
of 25 years' experience...

407
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,880
with an undercover
police officer...

408
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:25,382
and he wouldn't even tell me why.

409
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:28,385
l don't suppose you
would do me the courtesy

410
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,928
of filling me in.

411
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:31,388
l can't do that.

412
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,431
Oh.

413
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,474
You can't do that.

414
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:36,018
l'm watching you.

415
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,520
All l have to do
is tell my parents

416
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,522
that you're
with the police...

417
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,024
and they'll yank their kids

418
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,109
out of this school so fast...

419
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:45,611
we'd have to close.

420
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,404
And don't you think l won't

421
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:50,949
if l feel my children
are in any danger.

422
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:53,202
They're not in danger.

423
00:24:55,162 --> 00:25:00,167
l assume you have
some teaching experience.

424
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,711
They wouldn't have
sent me otherwise.

425
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,098
Just wait here a minute.

426
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:24,900
Everybody sit down
on the carpet!

427
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:33,242
Good morning, everyone.

428
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:36,954
Good morning, Miss Schlowski.

429
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:38,997
Your teacher, Mrs. Hagley

430
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:42,042
had to go on
an important trip.

431
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,210
Where'd she go?

432
00:25:43,293 --> 00:25:44,753
That doesn't matter.

433
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:46,088
Did she die?

434
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,383
No, Lowell.
She went to see someone.

435
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,759
Did they die?

436
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:52,928
No, Lowell.

437
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:54,930
Everyone dies, you know.

438
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:59,059
l know, but not
for a long, long time.

439
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,854
Now, until Mrs. Hagley
comes back...

440
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:05,524
we have someone special to help.

441
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,776
This is Mr. Kimble...

442
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,445
your new kindergarten teacher.

443
00:26:18,036 --> 00:26:23,750
Now, let's everybody say,
''Good morning, Mr. Kimble.''

444
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:28,130
Good morning, Mr. Kimble.

445
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,631
Good morning.

446
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:32,551
They're all yours.

447
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,636
l'll be watching you.

448
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,476
Hi.

449
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,939
How are you?

450
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:50,485
l'm very happy to be here.

451
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:53,488
First l would like
to just get to know you.

452
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,829
Quiet.

453
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:05,792
l'm going to ask you
a bunch of questions.

454
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,795
l want to have them
answered immediately.

455
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,798
How many of you
were born in Astoria?

456
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,429
Raise your hands.
Let's see them.

457
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:21,183
Okay, hmm.

458
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:25,521
Now, anyone that was not
born in Astoria...

459
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,189
somewhere outside
like California...

460
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:28,815
raise your hands.

461
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:37,991
Yes.

462
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,619
l need to go
to the bathroom.

463
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:43,705
Okay. You can go.

464
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,875
Boys have a penis.

465
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:49,378
Girls have a vagina.

466
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,507
Thanks for the tip.

467
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,885
Yes?

468
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,388
l need to go
to the bathroom...

469
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:02,015
and l can't get
these things off.

470
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,025
l'll get someone
to help you.

471
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,152
l'll be right back, okay?

472
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:24,496
You've learned that
the ''e'' is often silent

473
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,207
when it immediately
follows another vowel.

474
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:29,751
Now write and say
these words--

475
00:28:32,421 --> 00:28:33,672
Oh, um...

476
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,174
class, uh, Catherine...

477
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,177
can you take over
for me, please?

478
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,386
Thank you.

479
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,432
''E'' is the fifth letter
of the alphabet.

480
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,058
Yes, can l help you?

481
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,603
l have a problem.

482
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:49,229
Mr. Kimble...

483
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:52,191
l need to go real bad.

484
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,776
First day?

485
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,403
Yes.

486
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,946
l'll take care of her.

487
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,114
Thank you.

488
00:29:01,116 --> 00:29:04,745
You know, kindergarten
is like the ocean.

489
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,955
Don't turn your back on it.

490
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,707
They're okay.

491
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,417
Don't worry.

492
00:29:10,501 --> 00:29:12,127
Everything is under control.

493
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,965
No.

494
00:29:17,049 --> 00:29:18,383
Monsters.

495
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,306
What are you doing with this?

496
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:47,996
Aren't you going
to break it up?

497
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,998
No. Two more days of this...

498
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:51,959
and he'll quit.

499
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:04,263
Shut up!

500
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,808
Shut up! Shut up!

501
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,768
Shut up.

502
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:16,316
No.

503
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:17,818
Don't start this.

504
00:30:30,038 --> 00:30:32,499
Aah!

505
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,725
Attention!

506
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:57,065
This is your new class mascot.

507
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,151
What happened to your dog?

508
00:30:59,234 --> 00:31:01,570
This is not a dog.

509
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,071
This is a ferret.

510
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:04,573
What's a ferret?

511
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:05,991
That's a ferret.

512
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,534
Oh!

513
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:10,579
lf he bites you,
you get rabies and die.

514
00:31:10,621 --> 00:31:12,331
No. That's not true.

515
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:13,874
He never bites.

516
00:31:13,916 --> 00:31:15,334
Can l pet him?

517
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,337
Sure, but one at a time, okay?

518
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,256
Good. Okay, next one.
Come on.

519
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,091
Yes.

520
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,426
Good.

521
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:25,677
Yeah.

522
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,097
Good. Now we're having fun.

523
00:31:54,623 --> 00:31:57,084
What's that
supposed to mean?

524
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,962
Mrs. Hagley
is a lot better than you.

525
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:01,713
ls she?

526
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,633
ls she really?

527
00:32:06,635 --> 00:32:09,555
My mom's a teacher
in this school...

528
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,140
and she's a lot better
than you, too.

529
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,267
Great.

530
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,477
On Monday nights,
my mom tutors

531
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:17,980
and Mrs. Quinn
takes care of me.

532
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,815
She's better than you, too.

533
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,441
Great.

534
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:23,443
And Frankie,
my swimming teacher...

535
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:27,990
and Gus, my T-ball coach,
are better than you, too.

536
00:32:29,658 --> 00:32:31,577
l really appreciate
your honesty.

537
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:35,163
You happen to know someone
that's not better than me?

538
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:41,170
l don't know
that many people.

539
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:53,932
John?

540
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,642
Are you there?

541
00:33:00,189 --> 00:33:01,857
How did it go?

542
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:06,695
Go away.

543
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:08,989
lt went that well, huh?

544
00:33:10,782 --> 00:33:13,535
You take over tomorrow.

545
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,038
And blow our cover?

546
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,664
Can't do it.

547
00:33:19,124 --> 00:33:21,210
They're horrible.

548
00:33:21,293 --> 00:33:23,337
Tell me about it.

549
00:33:39,978 --> 00:33:41,230
He's gay.

550
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,982
What kind of a man
teaches kindergarten?

551
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:45,526
He's obviously gay.

552
00:33:45,609 --> 00:33:48,904
A male kindergarten teacher
isn't what l'm used to.

553
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,031
Samantha calls him
''The giant.''

554
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,993
There he is.

555
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,078
Where, honey?

556
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:02,918
Holy cow, is that
your new teacher?

557
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,086
Yeah.

558
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,712
Oh, my God.

559
00:34:06,672 --> 00:34:08,048
What are you doing?

560
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:10,843
- l'm not wearing makeup.
- None of us are.

561
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:13,345
You're married.
You're allowed to look like slobs.

562
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,849
Be good. l'll be back
to pick you up.

563
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,350
Good morning,
Mr. Kimble.

564
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:19,351
Good morning.

565
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,895
l told you he was big.

566
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:23,939
Play with the kids, honey.

567
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,569
Hi. l'm Jillian,
Sylvester's mom.

568
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,612
Do you have a minute?

569
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:33,073
l'd like to speak with you.

570
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:34,575
Sure.

571
00:34:34,616 --> 00:34:35,909
Please.

572
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,202
Thank you.

573
00:34:37,286 --> 00:34:38,704
A male kindergarten teacher.

574
00:34:38,787 --> 00:34:40,289
That's unusual.

575
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,293
You're not from
around here, are you?

576
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,295
No. l'm not.

577
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:47,796
Neither am l.

578
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,922
Huh.

579
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,633
Anyway...

580
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,093
um...

581
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,137
l have a small problem.

582
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,138
Yes?

583
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:57,639
You see, Sylvester's father

584
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:00,142
doesn't live with us anymore...

585
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,103
and l've just been
worried about Sylvester.

586
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,981
He's been acting
a little strange lately--

587
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:08,066
You know, doing odd things.

588
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,276
Like what?

589
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,154
Well, it seems
that's he's becoming

590
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:15,157
a little obsessed
with playing with dolls.

591
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,658
You know, it's weird.

592
00:35:16,742 --> 00:35:18,994
l think l can help you
with that.

593
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:20,454
Really?

594
00:35:20,495 --> 00:35:23,165
He uses the dolls
to look up girls' skirts.

595
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,667
l caught him
doing it yesterday.

596
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,170
Oh. Oh, well,
that's a relief.

597
00:35:28,253 --> 00:35:31,256
But l'll keep
an eye on him, okay?

598
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,841
Thank you.

599
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,469
Does Sylvester
ever see his father?

600
00:35:36,595 --> 00:35:40,015
No. No, not since he was 2.

601
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:42,935
His father lives in California.

602
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:45,020
That is far away.

603
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,605
Mm-hmm.

604
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,858
Well, if you give me
his name and number...

605
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,860
l could talk to him

606
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:54,196
about taking
more interest in his son.

607
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,490
That's very kind,
but l don't think so.

608
00:35:56,532 --> 00:35:59,159
But it's tough on Sylvester,
don't you think?

609
00:35:59,243 --> 00:36:00,285
No.

610
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:02,204
No, what's tough on Sylvester

611
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:04,706
is his father left us
for another man.

612
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:08,877
Are you married,
Mr. Kimble?

613
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,380
No, l'm not.

614
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:16,802
He's not married, Mom!

615
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,388
Welcome to Astoria...

616
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,723
the single-parent capital
of America.

617
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:23,600
Thank you for your time.

618
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,353
l pledge allegiance

619
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,730
to the flag

620
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:32,234
of the United States
of America...

621
00:36:32,276 --> 00:36:34,570
and to the republic

622
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:36,572
for which it stands...

623
00:36:36,655 --> 00:36:40,075
one nation, under God...

624
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,077
indivisible...

625
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,914
with liberty
and justice for all.

626
00:36:52,129 --> 00:36:54,173
Are these all your lunches?

627
00:36:55,632 --> 00:36:58,594
You mean you eat other
people's lunches?

628
00:36:58,677 --> 00:36:59,845
Stop it!

629
00:37:04,183 --> 00:37:07,853
Now we're going to do
something extremely fun.

630
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:10,856
We're going to play
a game called...

631
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:14,067
''Who is my daddy
and what does he do?''

632
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:15,027
Yes?

633
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,695
ls your daddy a fireman?

634
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:19,239
He's probably big.
ls he a wrestler?

635
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:20,949
A basketball coach?

636
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:21,950
No, no.

637
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,119
What's the matter?

638
00:37:24,203 --> 00:37:25,621
l have a headache.

639
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,414
lt might be a tumor.

640
00:37:27,456 --> 00:37:28,957
lt's not a tumor!

641
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:31,460
lt's not a tumor at all.

642
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:34,546
What l meant was...

643
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,591
you tell me who is your daddy

644
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:39,468
and what does he do?

645
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:40,802
Oh.

646
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:42,804
Get it?

647
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:44,473
We start right here. You.

648
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:49,645
My dad repairs cars
driven by women who are pinheads.

649
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:57,236
My dad doesn't do
anything since the crash.

650
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:01,073
My dad gives money to people
that doesn't have money...

651
00:38:01,156 --> 00:38:02,991
then people use that money...

652
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,494
then they give
other money back

653
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:07,829
and they give the same amount

654
00:38:07,913 --> 00:38:10,165
of money back to my dad.

655
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:12,960
My dad doesn't live
with us anymore.

656
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:16,255
He lives in New York
and drives a taxi.

657
00:38:16,338 --> 00:38:19,341
My mom hopes he's going to die
real soon.

658
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:26,515
My dad watches TV
all day long.

659
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:31,520
My dad works on computers...

660
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:36,525
and he's, um, the boss
of his company...

661
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:40,529
and, um, he has a mustache
and a beard.

662
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:41,530
Mm-hmm.

663
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:42,781
Yeah.

664
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:47,035
He doesn't have that
much hair because--

665
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,496
and he--
his head is so big

666
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:52,040
that he can't wear any hats.

667
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,042
My dad's divorced.

668
00:38:54,126 --> 00:38:56,336
My mom's divorced.

669
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:59,047
My dad, um,
is a psychologist...

670
00:38:59,131 --> 00:39:02,050
and he helps people
that are hurt

671
00:39:02,134 --> 00:39:04,011
or lost their feelings...

672
00:39:04,052 --> 00:39:06,305
and, um, that's it.

673
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:09,057
Our mom says that our dad

674
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,852
is a real sex machine.

675
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:18,317
Good.

676
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,320
l don't know
what my dad does.

677
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:24,239
l haven't seen him
in a long time.

678
00:39:24,323 --> 00:39:25,866
He lives in France.

679
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:30,412
My dad is a gynecologist...

680
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:34,041
and he looks at vaginas
all day long.

681
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:39,087
Mi papà trabaja
en la casa...

682
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:42,174
y èl juega conmigo mucho.

683
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,426
Thank you.
Very good.

684
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,094
Okay. Next, uh--

685
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:48,889
What's his name
with his back to me?

686
00:39:48,931 --> 00:39:50,265
His name's Zach Sullivan.

687
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:52,601
He doesn't like anyone
to talk to him.

688
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,102
He's a poo-poo head.

689
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:55,771
He's a poo-poo face.

690
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:57,940
He's a ca-ca poo-poo.

691
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,526
He's a poo-poo ca-ca.

692
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:03,529
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

693
00:40:03,612 --> 00:40:06,031
- Poo-poo ca-ca!
- Poo-poo ca-ca!

694
00:40:06,114 --> 00:40:07,032
Quiet.

695
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:08,075
That's enough.

696
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:12,788
Hey, Zach.

697
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,624
Did your daddy
teach you this game?

698
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:20,963
Come on, Zach.
Let's all play together.

699
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:22,965
lt's so much more fun.

700
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,299
Leave me alone!

701
00:40:25,801 --> 00:40:26,718
What's that?

702
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,429
lt's a fire alarm!

703
00:40:29,471 --> 00:40:30,806
Come on, come on.

704
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,559
Everyone together!
Come on.

705
00:40:33,642 --> 00:40:34,935
l'm on fire!

706
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,603
Come on. All together!

707
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:37,980
l'm on fire!

708
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:48,323
Very straight.
Very straight.

709
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,628
Come on, come on.
Get all together.

710
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:03,505
Everything together.
Come on.

711
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:05,591
Come on. Quiet.

712
00:41:05,674 --> 00:41:07,092
Quiet! Come on.

713
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:09,511
Shh! Quiet.

714
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:11,096
Well, we're all glad

715
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,308
the kindergarten class
could join us.

716
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:16,935
That's four minutes.

717
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,521
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

718
00:41:20,856 --> 00:41:23,025
All the other grades...

719
00:41:23,108 --> 00:41:25,027
your times were an improvement...

720
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,945
but they're still
not good enough.

721
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:28,030
but they're still
not good enough.

722
00:41:28,113 --> 00:41:30,324
l'm very disappointed.

723
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:34,161
All right, let's get
back into school.

724
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,185
Mrs. Sullivan!

725
00:41:59,895 --> 00:42:01,980
Mrs. Sullivan!

726
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:11,240
So the doctor says
it's a stomach flu.

727
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:14,368
l'm fine. l can
eat anything l want.

728
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:15,869
Let's find a restaurant.

729
00:42:15,911 --> 00:42:17,371
Can we talk business?

730
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:19,873
There are 14 boys
in the classroom.

731
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:23,377
So far l have three possible suspects,
one likely.

732
00:42:23,418 --> 00:42:25,254
Here's a picture.
You listening?

733
00:42:25,337 --> 00:42:26,672
l'm listening.

734
00:42:26,755 --> 00:42:28,715
His name's Zach Sullivan.
What do you think?

735
00:42:28,757 --> 00:42:31,760
He's cute.
Doesn't anybody eat around here?

736
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:34,680
Listen, he's a dead ringer
for Crisp. Look.

737
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:39,184
Maybe. Come on, John.
l'm hungry.

738
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,603
A table for two.
Thank you very much.

739
00:42:41,645 --> 00:42:43,105
Two hot dogs.

740
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:44,606
Two hot dogs?

741
00:42:44,648 --> 00:42:46,108
Mr. Kimble!
Mr. Kimble!

742
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:47,109
Dominic.

743
00:42:47,192 --> 00:42:48,777
lt's him, Mom.

744
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:50,279
Joyce.

745
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:51,405
Hello, Joyce.

746
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,782
Dominic has been a great help.

747
00:42:53,866 --> 00:42:55,409
He's a good kid.

748
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,451
Who's that?

749
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,452
Who?

750
00:42:57,494 --> 00:42:59,079
Her.

751
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,122
Oh, that?

752
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:01,874
Uh, that is, uh--

753
00:43:01,957 --> 00:43:04,293
l am his sister.

754
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:05,294
Oh, really?

755
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:06,795
l wouldn't have guessed.

756
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:08,630
You have to excuse my brother.

757
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,090
He has no manners.

758
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:12,593
My name is Ursula.
Wonderful to meet you.

759
00:43:12,634 --> 00:43:14,636
l'm visiting here
from Austria.

760
00:43:14,678 --> 00:43:17,639
l'm Joyce Paulmarie.
l work at John's school.

761
00:43:17,723 --> 00:43:18,724
Ah.

762
00:43:18,807 --> 00:43:20,142
And this is Dominic.

763
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:21,602
Nice to meet you.

764
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,605
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

765
00:43:24,646 --> 00:43:26,064
- No.
- Ja.

766
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,274
Ja.

767
00:43:27,316 --> 00:43:30,110
Yes, of course.
That would be great.

768
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:33,071
Hi. There will
be four of us.

769
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,323
Table 27.

770
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,576
Why did you tell her
you were my sister?

771
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:40,996
Relax, butch.
The love doctor is here.

772
00:43:41,038 --> 00:43:43,457
Come to me.
l want to start.

773
00:43:43,498 --> 00:43:46,585
Okay. l want
a rib eye steak

774
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,086
with mashed potatoes

775
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:50,088
and a large green salad.

776
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:51,590
Oh, no.
Wait a minute.

777
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:53,133
l want to start

778
00:43:53,175 --> 00:43:55,761
with the spicy
chicken wings.

779
00:43:55,928 --> 00:43:58,430
Are they the tiny ones
without meat?

780
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,432
Actually, it's quite
a large serving.

781
00:44:00,516 --> 00:44:01,808
Ah, good.

782
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,310
Ooh, good arms.

783
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:07,523
And a large bowl
of the clam chowder.

784
00:44:07,606 --> 00:44:09,858
Uh, and the blueberry pie

785
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,693
with ice cream for dessert.

786
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:12,819
Ja.

787
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,865
l like how they talk.

788
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,453
l've been trying to get to
know the parents...

789
00:44:21,537 --> 00:44:23,872
but some of them
are avoiding me.

790
00:44:23,956 --> 00:44:25,374
Some of them
are like that.

791
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:27,376
lt's a strange town that way...

792
00:44:27,459 --> 00:44:28,877
especially with new arrivals.

793
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:29,878
What do you mean?

794
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,047
l think a lot of people

795
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:33,549
that come to small towns

796
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:35,384
are trying to get
away from something

797
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:37,219
or they're
hiding something.

798
00:44:37,302 --> 00:44:38,387
Like what?

799
00:44:39,805 --> 00:44:42,724
Well, for example,
what brought you here?

800
00:44:42,808 --> 00:44:44,726
Me? Well,
there was an opening

801
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:46,395
for a kindergarten teacher.

802
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:49,189
Yeah, but what made you
become a kindergarten teacher?

803
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,650
l mean, it is a bit unusual.

804
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,318
John is a bit unusual.

805
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:54,319
Well--

806
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:55,320
You are.

807
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:56,738
l was born in Austria.

808
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:58,240
My father was a teacher.

809
00:44:58,323 --> 00:44:59,700
My mother was a teacher.

810
00:44:59,741 --> 00:45:00,826
So is Ursula.

811
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,035
Ja.

812
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:03,912
We have a tradition in Austria

813
00:45:03,996 --> 00:45:06,665
where we follow
the footsteps of our parents.

814
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,084
So when l moved
to this country...

815
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:10,419
l taught geography

816
00:45:10,544 --> 00:45:12,796
and physical education
in Arizona...

817
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,631
and then l coached basketball

818
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:17,718
at an all-girls school
in Rhode lsland, but...

819
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:21,638
none of it made me
really happy.

820
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:23,849
Why weren't you happy?

821
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:26,268
Ja. Why weren't you happy?

822
00:45:27,603 --> 00:45:29,980
Well, l got tired of
teaching teenagers...

823
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:32,441
because by the time
they came to me...

824
00:45:32,524 --> 00:45:35,944
l felt there wasn't
much l could do with them.

825
00:45:35,986 --> 00:45:39,114
l realized that the real action
is in kindergarten.

826
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:41,241
How long have you been
teaching kindergarten?

827
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:43,076
lt's my second day.

828
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,494
Oh.

829
00:45:46,622 --> 00:45:50,083
Ooh, excuse me,
but it's good.

830
00:45:50,167 --> 00:45:51,668
lt is good.

831
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:52,669
Thanks again.

832
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:54,963
Nice to meet you.

833
00:45:55,047 --> 00:45:55,964
Thank you.

834
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,674
Bye.

835
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,134
l had a great time.

836
00:45:59,218 --> 00:46:00,636
Ja, me, too.

837
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:03,764
Well, Kimble,
l think you scored.

838
00:46:06,934 --> 00:46:08,185
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

839
00:46:08,268 --> 00:46:09,645
What are you talking about?

840
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,104
l'm only interested in her

841
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:13,148
because she works
at the school.

842
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:15,108
She knows the children
and the parents.

843
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,527
lf you were any stiffer...

844
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:17,945
we could take you surfing.

845
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,947
Now, l know you
like that woman.

846
00:46:19,988 --> 00:46:21,198
What is your problem?

847
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:22,658
The only problem l've got

848
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,868
is that l'm doing your job.

849
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,870
You should be
cleaning up the paint

850
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,872
and reading stories
about bears that go shopping.

851
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,624
l'm stuck with your job.

852
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:32,042
Yeah. You are.

853
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:34,002
That's right. l am.

854
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,505
Look, you're going
to be out of here

855
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:38,006
in a few days.

856
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,968
You told me yourself
you had a few good leads.

857
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:43,220
You'll be back dealing
with junkies and murderers

858
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,346
in no time.

859
00:46:55,607 --> 00:46:58,026
They're pushing me around.

860
00:46:58,068 --> 00:46:59,736
Who?

861
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:00,904
The kids.

862
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,741
They're walking all over me.

863
00:47:11,498 --> 00:47:12,499
Listen, Kimble.

864
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:13,917
You got to handle this

865
00:47:14,001 --> 00:47:15,419
like any other police situation.

866
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:17,921
You walk into it showing fear...

867
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,673
you're dead...

868
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:22,551
and those kids know you're scared.

869
00:47:27,306 --> 00:47:28,682
No fear.

870
00:47:30,309 --> 00:47:31,518
No fear.

871
00:47:34,188 --> 00:47:37,065
Today we're going to play
a new fun game.

872
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:39,902
lt's called ''police school.''

873
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:41,862
l'm going to be your sheriff.

874
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:45,240
You're going to be
my deputy trainees.

875
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:48,368
Come on.

876
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,620
Stop whining.

877
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:53,290
You kids are soft.

878
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,083
You lack discipline.

879
00:47:56,543 --> 00:47:57,711
Well, l've got news for you.

880
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,380
You are mine now.
You belong to me!

881
00:48:02,508 --> 00:48:04,301
You're not going to have
your mommies here

882
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:05,469
to wipe your tushies.

883
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,803
Oh, no.

884
00:48:06,887 --> 00:48:09,598
lt's time to turn
this mush into muscles.

885
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:13,227
No more complaining.

886
00:48:13,268 --> 00:48:15,771
No more, ''l have to go
to the bathroom.''

887
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,774
There is no bathroom!

888
00:48:22,277 --> 00:48:25,656
Now, the first thing the
deputy trainees have to learn

889
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,825
is to freeze
whenever you hear this.

890
00:48:31,954 --> 00:48:34,665
Now, the next time you hear
this whistle...

891
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,000
each one of you get
one toy.

892
00:48:37,084 --> 00:48:38,001
How many?

893
00:48:38,126 --> 00:48:39,336
One!

894
00:48:39,419 --> 00:48:41,421
Good. Then bring it back
to the carpet...

895
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,464
pronto.

896
00:48:42,506 --> 00:48:43,507
Ready?

897
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:46,093
Wait for it.

898
00:48:46,176 --> 00:48:48,095
Wait for it.

899
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:49,847
Sit down.

900
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,432
Ready?

901
00:48:53,392 --> 00:48:54,309
Go quickly.

902
00:48:54,393 --> 00:48:55,310
Get your toy.

903
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:56,353
Go.

904
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:57,521
Go for it.

905
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:59,481
Yes. Very fast.

906
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:00,607
Good. Quickly.

907
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:02,860
Bring the toy
back to the carpet.

908
00:49:02,943 --> 00:49:05,195
Bring it back
to the carpet.

909
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,446
Quick, quick, quick.

910
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,365
Back to the carpet.

911
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,658
Quickly.

912
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:13,704
Emma.

913
00:49:15,831 --> 00:49:16,832
Emma...

914
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,042
take your toy
to the carpet.

915
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:23,005
l'm not a policeman.
l'm a princess.

916
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:25,591
Take your toy
back to the carpet.

917
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,385
l'm not a policeman!

918
00:49:28,468 --> 00:49:29,511
l'm a princess.

919
00:49:29,595 --> 00:49:31,221
Take it back!

920
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:34,183
All right.

921
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:43,817
Very good.

922
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:45,360
You did very well.

923
00:49:45,402 --> 00:49:47,738
Now we're going to
play another game.

924
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:50,324
When you hear
two whistle blows...

925
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,243
take your toy back
where you got it

926
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,870
and come right back.

927
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,580
How many whistle blows?

928
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:57,748
- Two!
- Two!

929
00:49:57,831 --> 00:49:59,583
Good. Ready?

930
00:50:01,335 --> 00:50:02,377
Go.

931
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:03,587
Come on.

932
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,881
Come right back
to the carpet.

933
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,382
Yes. lt works.

934
00:50:07,466 --> 00:50:08,383
This is great.

935
00:50:08,425 --> 00:50:09,885
Faster, faster.

936
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,011
Come on.

937
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,513
Yes. Come back. Terrific.

938
00:50:12,554 --> 00:50:13,889
This is working. Wait.

939
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,726
l mean, you're
very good deputies.

940
00:50:19,937 --> 00:50:22,898
Your sheriff
is proud of you.

941
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:32,783
1, 2, 3, 4.

942
00:50:32,866 --> 00:50:34,785
1, 2, 3, 4.

943
00:50:34,868 --> 00:50:36,787
1, 2, 3, 4.

944
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,622
1, 2, 3, 4.

945
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:46,296
Wait! Take me.

946
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,966
Down. Up. Down.

947
00:50:49,049 --> 00:50:50,467
Yes, yes, yes!

948
00:50:50,551 --> 00:50:51,593
You've got it.

949
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:54,721
Yes, Wanda. Good.

950
00:50:56,431 --> 00:50:57,766
Very good.

951
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,893
Big circles. Big circles.

952
00:50:59,977 --> 00:51:01,103
Good.

953
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:03,480
Now do the same thing.
Way back.

954
00:51:03,564 --> 00:51:05,107
And down in big circles.

955
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,149
Big circles.

956
00:51:16,577 --> 00:51:17,661
Yes.

957
00:51:25,627 --> 00:51:27,754
This is a fire drill!

958
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:29,631
This is a fire drill.

959
00:51:29,673 --> 00:51:30,674
Run to the door.

960
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:34,595
Dominic, don't forget Ferret.

961
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:36,430
Yes. lt's a fire drill.

962
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:37,472
Come on.

963
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:41,143
Oh, this is terrible.

964
00:51:41,226 --> 00:51:43,770
Come on. Come on.

965
00:51:45,147 --> 00:51:47,524
29.

966
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:48,942
30.

967
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:50,819
31.

968
00:51:50,903 --> 00:51:52,529
32.

969
00:51:52,613 --> 00:51:54,615
33.

970
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:55,657
One more.

971
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,035
Come on.
Down and up.

972
00:51:58,118 --> 00:51:59,036
Yes!

973
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:00,037
Yes!

974
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:01,330
Zach is the winner.

975
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:02,956
Come on, you guys.

976
00:52:10,172 --> 00:52:12,174
March, 2, 3, 4.

977
00:52:12,257 --> 00:52:14,218
March, 2, 3, 4.

978
00:52:14,301 --> 00:52:15,302
Swing your arms.

979
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:16,970
2, 3, 4.

980
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,473
Swing them high.
2, 3, 4.

981
00:52:19,515 --> 00:52:21,642
1, 2, 3, 4.

982
00:52:21,725 --> 00:52:24,019
1, 2, 3, 4.

983
00:52:24,978 --> 00:52:26,146
Wow.

984
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,357
1, 2, 3, 4!

985
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,858
Reading, writing, arithmetic.

986
00:52:29,942 --> 00:52:32,819
Reading, writing, arithmetic!

987
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:35,072
Too much homework
makes me sick.

988
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:37,324
Too much homework
makes me sick!

989
00:52:37,366 --> 00:52:39,743
When it's time
to pass the test...

990
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,204
When it's time
to pass the test...

991
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:44,373
kindergarten is the best.

992
00:52:44,456 --> 00:52:46,500
kindergarten is the best.

993
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:48,752
Yay!

994
00:52:48,836 --> 00:52:51,839
E-l-E-l-O

995
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:56,552
And on that farm
he had a duck

996
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,596
E-l-E-l-O

997
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,352
All right.
Take your milk.

998
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:07,896
lt makes you big and strong.

999
00:53:11,817 --> 00:53:13,277
lt's story time, Mr. Kimble.

1000
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,236
All right.

1001
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,737
We all like this one...

1002
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:18,240
and if you read us a story now...

1003
00:53:18,282 --> 00:53:20,242
everybody will go to sleep.

1004
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,285
All right.

1005
00:53:32,254 --> 00:53:34,715
l used to read this to my son.

1006
00:53:34,756 --> 00:53:35,883
What's his name?

1007
00:53:35,924 --> 00:53:36,800
Who?

1008
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,760
Your son.

1009
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:41,471
Oh, Alex is his name.

1010
00:53:41,555 --> 00:53:42,973
Where is he?

1011
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,933
He lives with his mother.

1012
00:53:52,524 --> 00:53:55,152
You see, his mother and l...

1013
00:53:55,235 --> 00:53:56,111
we are--

1014
00:53:56,195 --> 00:53:57,779
Divorced. l know.

1015
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,406
What's a divorce?

1016
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:02,326
lt's when your daddy
lives someplace else

1017
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:04,286
and comes over
to take you places...

1018
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,997
and your mommy says
he's a deadbeat.

1019
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,665
No. lt's when the daddy

1020
00:54:08,749 --> 00:54:11,293
doesn't want to see
his little boy anymore.

1021
00:54:11,376 --> 00:54:12,836
That's not what it is.

1022
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,589
Why don't you want to see
your little boy?

1023
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,673
Was he bad?

1024
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,842
No, he was not bad.

1025
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:23,805
lt wasn't his fault at all.

1026
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:24,973
You see...

1027
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:28,310
his mommy and l,
we just nev--

1028
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:38,779
Just sit down, okay?

1029
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,615
Let me just start reading.

1030
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:44,159
Why don't you all lie down?

1031
00:54:44,201 --> 00:54:45,202
Okay.

1032
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:47,955
Good. And rest.

1033
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:54,545
''If you were a bird
and Iived on high

1034
00:54:54,586 --> 00:54:58,549
you'd Iean on the wind
when the wind came by.

1035
00:54:58,632 --> 00:55:01,468
You'd say to the wind
when it tooK you away...

1036
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:04,054
That's where
I wanted to go today.

1037
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:09,393
Where am I going?
I don't quite Know.

1038
00:55:09,434 --> 00:55:12,646
What does it matter
where peopIe go?

1039
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:16,316
Down to the wood
where the bIuebeIIs grow.

1040
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,776
Anywhere.

1041
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:19,486
Anywhere.

1042
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,071
I don't Know.''

1043
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:01,320
Huh!

1044
00:56:03,405 --> 00:56:04,615
Hi.

1045
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:06,783
Hi.

1046
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,625
I didn't mean
to startIe you.

1047
00:56:18,295 --> 00:56:21,048
I must have dozed off.

1048
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:24,134
I can't beIieve you
got them aII to sIeep.

1049
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,803
I worKed them hard.

1050
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,182
I was wondering if...

1051
00:56:30,265 --> 00:56:32,684
you'd IiKe to come
to my pIace for dinner

1052
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:33,977
tomorrow night.

1053
00:56:35,812 --> 00:56:38,023
I wouId IiKe that.

1054
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:39,691
Yes.

1055
00:56:39,775 --> 00:56:40,817
Great.

1056
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,903
WeII, here are
the directions.

1057
00:56:42,986 --> 00:56:44,571
How about 6:30, 7:00?

1058
00:56:45,906 --> 00:56:47,407
That wouId be fine.

1059
00:56:53,372 --> 00:56:54,414
What?

1060
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,416
Um--

1061
00:56:58,001 --> 00:57:00,671
You-- You've got
a IittIe mustache.

1062
00:57:00,712 --> 00:57:04,007
Oh, it must be
from the miIK.

1063
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,683
WeII, I'd better
get bacK to cIass.

1064
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:16,603
I'II see you tomorrow.

1065
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,230
See you tomorrow.

1066
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:14,870
Freeze!

1067
00:58:15,037 --> 00:58:16,038
No!

1068
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:19,750
No.

1069
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:22,211
This is Henry Shoop...

1070
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:24,129
my fiancè.

1071
00:58:25,631 --> 00:58:26,673
Hi.

1072
00:58:27,758 --> 00:58:28,675
Your fiancè?

1073
00:58:28,759 --> 00:58:30,469
Yeah, my fiancè.

1074
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,972
Henry, this is
obviousIy my partner...

1075
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,140
John KimbIe.

1076
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,141
Oh, jeez.

1077
00:58:36,225 --> 00:58:37,643
Uh--

1078
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:38,644
Hi.

1079
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:39,937
How you doing?

1080
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,188
Let me get this...

1082
00:58:42,648 --> 00:58:43,565
Oh!

1083
00:58:43,649 --> 00:58:45,108
It's oKay, honey.

1084
00:58:45,192 --> 00:58:46,652
I'II be right out.

1085
00:58:46,735 --> 00:58:48,153
It's my birthday.

1086
00:58:48,195 --> 00:58:49,488
WeII, congratuIations.

1087
00:58:49,571 --> 00:58:52,491
ThanKs. He came up here
just to surprise me.

1088
00:58:52,574 --> 00:58:55,994
And he made me my favorite--
pasta a oIio.

1089
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:03,961
I Iove you, Henry.

1090
00:59:04,044 --> 00:59:05,295
I Iove you, too, Phoebes.

1091
00:59:05,379 --> 00:59:08,215
Uh-- WeII, I've got
to head bacK tonight.

1092
00:59:08,298 --> 00:59:09,716
I've got to worK.

1093
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,343
Henry's a chef.

1094
00:59:11,426 --> 00:59:12,678
I'm a chef.

1095
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:14,179
You're marrying a chef?

1096
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,181
I'm marrying
a great chef.

1097
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:17,224
That figures.

1098
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,518
You mean that,
a great chef?

1099
00:59:19,601 --> 00:59:21,520
Of course.
You're a genius, Henry.

1100
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,438
Not just a good chef?

1101
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,940
WeII, nice to meet you.

1102
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,233
CongratuIations.
Happy birthday.

1103
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,485
ThanKs.
You want some of this?

1104
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,653
It wasn't overcooKed?

1105
00:59:29,736 --> 00:59:30,863
You're the best.

1106
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,281
It wasn't a IittIe overcooKed?

1107
00:59:32,364 --> 00:59:33,699
No. AI dente.

1108
00:59:43,542 --> 00:59:44,543
Zach.

1109
00:59:47,546 --> 00:59:50,465
Excuse me. I'm John KimbIe,
Zach's teacher.

1110
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:53,468
I didn't Know
he was foIIowing me.

1111
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:56,471
Hi. I've been Ieaving messages
on your machine.

1112
00:59:56,555 --> 00:59:58,974
I'm sorry.
Things have been hectic.

1113
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,976
What about now?

1114
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,895
Uh--

1115
01:00:04,062 --> 01:00:05,814
Go for a IittIe waIK.

1116
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,901
Your teacher and I
have to taIK.

1117
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:18,535
Uh--

1118
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:21,246
I Know what this is about.

1119
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,421
I suppose you saw
the bruises on Zach's Iegs?

1120
01:00:31,882 --> 01:00:34,593
My husband has started
counseIing about this.

1121
01:00:34,676 --> 01:00:37,471
He's been going
for three weeKs now.

1122
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:40,307
PIease don't bring
the schooI system into it.

1123
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,309
It wiII maKe matters worse.

1124
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:43,769
He's beating you, too?

1125
01:00:46,063 --> 01:00:47,940
If he wasn't going
to counseIing...

1126
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:50,984
I couId see the point
of saying something...

1127
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:54,446
but I'm sure there won't be
any more occurrences.

1128
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:57,074
You won't say anything,
wiII you?

1129
01:00:58,784 --> 01:01:00,494
PIease?

1130
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,958
If he does it again,
I press charges.

1131
01:01:17,553 --> 01:01:18,804
Zach.

1132
01:01:37,447 --> 01:01:38,866
You got the stuff?

1133
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:42,035
ThanKs, man.

1134
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:53,005
Here, Iady.
I gave her your stuff.

1135
01:01:53,088 --> 01:01:55,549
Where's the rest of my money?

1136
01:01:56,884 --> 01:01:58,969
Who are you, oId Iady?

1137
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,929
Your fairy godmother.

1138
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:06,185
Come in.

1139
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:07,936
Hi. It tooK aII day...

1140
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,981
but I found out Zach SuIIivan
and his mother...

1141
01:02:11,064 --> 01:02:13,859
aren't reIated to Crisp.
I just found out.

1142
01:02:13,942 --> 01:02:17,988
Oh. I got a bottIe of wine
for your big date--

1143
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:20,324
It's not a date, I Know.

1144
01:02:20,407 --> 01:02:21,909
But Joyce shouIdn't thinK that.

1145
01:02:21,992 --> 01:02:24,745
ThanKs. I don't thinK
it's a good idea.

1146
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:27,581
QuicKest way to sIip up
doing undercover worK

1147
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,459
is doing things
you normaIIy wouIdn't do.

1148
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:31,960
Wait a minute.

1149
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:34,421
You mean you wouIdn't taKe wine

1150
01:02:34,505 --> 01:02:37,466
to a woman
who's invited you for dinner?

1151
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:38,967
Of course you wouId.

1152
01:02:39,051 --> 01:02:42,054
And fIowers as weII.
Here you go.

1153
01:02:43,263 --> 01:02:44,598
She'II Iove them.

1154
01:03:00,447 --> 01:03:02,282
WeII, here we are.

1155
01:03:02,366 --> 01:03:04,785
Wow. This is
quite a pIace.

1156
01:03:04,868 --> 01:03:06,578
They must be paying you

1157
01:03:06,662 --> 01:03:09,498
a Iot more than
they're paying me.

1158
01:03:09,581 --> 01:03:11,458
I wish it was my house.

1159
01:03:11,542 --> 01:03:14,294
It beIongs to a friend of mine.

1160
01:03:14,378 --> 01:03:17,297
After the divorce,
he said we couId stay here

1161
01:03:17,381 --> 01:03:21,176
in exchange
for Keeping the pIace up.

1162
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:22,928
You must have nice friends.

1163
01:03:23,011 --> 01:03:24,221
Yes, I do.

1164
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:27,057
Dinner won't be ready
for a few minutes.

1165
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,892
Can you start a fire?

1166
01:03:28,976 --> 01:03:30,811
It shouIdn't be a probIem.

1167
01:03:30,894 --> 01:03:33,939
I'II show you
where the wood is.

1168
01:03:35,065 --> 01:03:36,525
Come on. Come on!

1169
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:40,028
Right here.

1170
01:03:46,618 --> 01:03:47,703
In here.

1171
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:51,456
This is my secret hiding spot.

1172
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,958
Wow.

1173
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,459
This is amazing.

1174
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:55,961
I made it myseIf.

1175
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:56,962
What's this?

1176
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:58,463
Don't touch that!

1177
01:03:58,547 --> 01:03:59,965
It's a Iaser...

1178
01:04:00,048 --> 01:04:02,968
and it'II burn a hoIe
right through you.

1179
01:04:03,051 --> 01:04:04,303
OKay. I'II be carefuI.

1180
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:05,637
Oh, don't shoot.

1181
01:04:05,721 --> 01:04:07,639
- Boom! Boom!
- Don't shoot.

1182
01:04:07,723 --> 01:04:11,310
I put up these Iasers
to protect us.

1183
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:15,981
To protect you from what?

1184
01:04:16,064 --> 01:04:17,691
The bad peopIe.

1185
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:20,986
Do you want to see
something eIse?

1186
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,281
Come on.

1187
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,408
What?

1188
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:28,160
See that?

1189
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:30,913
You mean the tower?

1190
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:34,917
I'm going to pIant one
of my Iasers on that antenna.

1191
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,961
But I'II have to do it at night.

1192
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:41,507
Otherwise the bad peopIe
wiII Know where it is.

1193
01:04:44,051 --> 01:04:47,513
Last one to the tabIe
is a rotten banana!

1194
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:49,515
Have you guys had fun?

1195
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:51,099
Yeah. Be right out!

1196
01:05:47,656 --> 01:05:49,741
What you doing in there?

1197
01:05:49,825 --> 01:05:50,909
I'm Iost.

1198
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,911
Where is the dining room?

1199
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:55,664
This house is huge.

1200
01:05:55,747 --> 01:06:00,419
- FoIIow me, siIIy.
- Whew.

1201
01:06:00,502 --> 01:06:03,463
These are beautifuI pictures
of you and Dominic.

1202
01:06:03,547 --> 01:06:04,548
ThanK you.

1203
01:06:06,508 --> 01:06:09,261
When I was putting
Dominic to bed...

1204
01:06:09,344 --> 01:06:11,930
he mentioned you had a son, too.

1205
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:13,765
That's right.
But I'm divorced.

1206
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:17,978
I'm IucKy. My ex got remarried
to a very nice man.

1207
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:20,480
He's reaIIy good to my son.

1208
01:06:20,564 --> 01:06:22,191
I see him a Iot.

1209
01:06:22,274 --> 01:06:24,151
What about your ex-husband?

1210
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:26,653
Does he see Dominic a Iot?

1211
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:30,699
Uh, no. After the divorce,
he moved bacK to France.

1212
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:34,453
What about chiId support
and aIimony?

1213
01:06:34,494 --> 01:06:36,872
Does he taKe care of you?

1214
01:06:38,332 --> 01:06:40,834
I'm sorry about
being so personaI.

1215
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:47,174
I was so gIad to see him go

1216
01:06:47,257 --> 01:06:49,635
I didn't worry
about that part.

1217
01:06:49,676 --> 01:06:51,428
Dominic doesn't even remember him.

1218
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:53,263
I prefer it that way.

1219
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:55,349
Are you sure?

1220
01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:57,726
Yeah.

1221
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:00,354
Why?

1222
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,856
WeII, Dominic was taIKing to me

1223
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,859
about having to move around a Iot

1224
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:08,695
to Keep the bad peopIe away.

1225
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,240
Bad peopIe?

1226
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:13,033
Something about having to Ieave

1227
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,369
in the middIe of the night

1228
01:07:15,452 --> 01:07:17,371
and Ieave his toys behind.

1229
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:21,416
Oh, God.

1230
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:24,378
I thought he'd
forgotten about that.

1231
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:29,424
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

1232
01:07:29,508 --> 01:07:30,968
It's not your fauIt.

1233
01:07:31,051 --> 01:07:35,013
The truth is, my ex-husband
is a waIKing nightmare.

1234
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:38,517
He didn't Ieave us, we Ieft him.

1235
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,019
He found out where we were

1236
01:07:41,061 --> 01:07:43,021
and tried to Kidnap Dominic.

1237
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:46,024
He doesn't Know where we are now...

1238
01:07:46,108 --> 01:07:49,194
and I'd IiKe to Keep it that way.

1239
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:51,864
Of course.

1240
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:55,909
I'm gIad he's in France
and doesn't Iive nearby.

1241
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:03,584
He doesn't Iive in France.

1242
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:09,798
I toId Dominic
that he Iived in France.

1243
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:16,096
I didn't Know who my ex-husband was
when I married him.

1244
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:20,934
I was young and stupid,
and I made a mistaKe.

1245
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:26,106
I don't want Dominic
to pay for it.

1246
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:34,448
LooK, nobody around here
Knows anything about this.

1247
01:08:34,531 --> 01:08:38,076
I can't even beIieve
I toId you.

1248
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:44,708
You have to promise me
you won't teII anyone.

1249
01:08:47,544 --> 01:08:49,421
You can trust me.

1250
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:55,427
That's very good. Perfect.

1251
01:08:55,511 --> 01:08:57,513
OKay. Let's try it again.

1252
01:08:57,596 --> 01:09:00,182
Mary, you first.

1253
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:04,353
Fourscores and seven years ago.

1254
01:09:04,436 --> 01:09:07,814
Fourscores and seven years ago.

1255
01:09:07,898 --> 01:09:10,400
Our forefathers brought--

1256
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,611
Four fathers?

1257
01:09:12,694 --> 01:09:15,906
Mr. KimbIe, did LincoIn
have four fathers?

1258
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:17,533
Uh--

1259
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:18,825
I had three fathers--

1260
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:20,786
One named WaIt,
two named RaIph.

1261
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:26,083
Did LincoIn have
four mothers?

1262
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:29,127
As a matter of fact,
he had two mothers.

1263
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:31,129
UnfortunateIy,
the first one died.

1264
01:09:31,213 --> 01:09:32,548
I Knew it.

1265
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:37,970
Um-- OKay.

1266
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:39,763
Let's taKe a breaK.
Come on.

1267
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:44,935
I want you to waIK around
in a circIe. Go.

1268
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,229
Start. Come on.

1269
01:09:50,065 --> 01:09:52,985
WeII, Joyce's story
about the house checKed out.

1270
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,988
It beIongs to a guy
who onIy uses it

1271
01:09:56,071 --> 01:09:57,489
during the sKi season.

1272
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:00,325
She's got under §1,000
in the banK...

1273
01:10:00,409 --> 01:10:04,997
no stocKs, no bonds, no other assets
under the name Joyce PauImarie.

1274
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,834
Her teacher's saIary is Iess than mine,
which is pathetic.

1275
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,921
Keep IooKing. ChecK for offshore
accounts under Dominic's name--

1276
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:15,924
She doesn't Iive IiKe someone
with miIIions of doIIars.

1277
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:18,218
She doesn't even
seem the type.

1278
01:10:18,302 --> 01:10:20,470
KimbIe, this might not be her.

1279
01:10:20,554 --> 01:10:21,847
It's got to be her.

1280
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,349
Why? Because she
doesn't want to have

1281
01:10:24,433 --> 01:10:26,852
anything to do
with her ex-husband?

1282
01:10:26,894 --> 01:10:28,228
I Know it's her.

1283
01:10:28,312 --> 01:10:29,688
Know what I thinK?

1284
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:32,191
You want it to be her.

1285
01:10:32,274 --> 01:10:35,277
You reaIIy IiKe her,
and it's scaring you.

1286
01:10:36,361 --> 01:10:37,946
Excuse me!

1287
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,072
Surprise!

1288
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:40,449
Ladies!

1289
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:42,868
Ladies, surprise.

1290
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:45,454
ObviousIy, I'm not
into baKing caKes...

1291
01:10:45,537 --> 01:10:47,956
so I brought
these IittIe things

1292
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,792
to donate
for the raffIe prizes.

1293
01:10:50,876 --> 01:10:53,337
Who the heII is that?

1294
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:56,381
She's the one
I was teIIing you about.

1295
01:10:56,465 --> 01:10:59,968
Her husband ran away
with another guy.

1296
01:11:00,052 --> 01:11:02,054
It's been terribIe for her.

1297
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:09,728
You're not getting
meIIow on me, are you?

1298
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:10,729
3, 4.

1299
01:11:10,812 --> 01:11:12,231
1, 2, 3--

1300
01:11:12,314 --> 01:11:13,232
Hi.

1301
01:11:13,315 --> 01:11:15,734
Come on. 1, 2, 3, 4.

1302
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,486
Come on. Go, go.

1303
01:11:17,569 --> 01:11:21,865
I see they stucK you
with the Gettysburg Address this year.

1304
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,617
They sure did.

1305
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,119
Company, haIt!

1306
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,126
Um--

1307
01:11:34,169 --> 01:11:35,796
About Iast night--

1308
01:11:35,879 --> 01:11:39,174
I've been thinKing
about it, and...

1309
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:43,303
I'm gIad I toId you
aII those things.

1310
01:11:43,387 --> 01:11:44,763
So am I.

1311
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,977
Um-- I-I better
get going.

1312
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,646
Yeah. I have
to get going, too.

1313
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:57,651
Is everything oKay?

1314
01:11:57,734 --> 01:11:58,777
Yeah.

1315
01:12:00,195 --> 01:12:02,531
See you tomorrow at the fair.

1316
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,867
I'm IooKing forward to it.

1317
01:12:08,912 --> 01:12:10,789
What are you IooKing at?

1318
01:12:10,873 --> 01:12:11,832
Ha ha ha!

1319
01:12:11,915 --> 01:12:12,916
Shh!

1320
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,211
March! 1, 2, 3, 4.

1321
01:12:16,295 --> 01:12:21,008
I was just taIKing
to the teacher, that's aII.

1322
01:12:21,091 --> 01:12:23,635
Yeah. Don't Iaugh.

1323
01:12:24,928 --> 01:12:27,806
OKay. I'm proud of you.
Keep going.

1324
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:30,809
I'm sorry Zach's Iate.
The car wouIdn't start.

1325
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:32,811
You be a good boy.

1326
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:34,354
I Iove you.

1327
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,024
Hi, champ.

1328
01:12:37,107 --> 01:12:38,483
Oh!

1329
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:39,902
What's the matter?

1330
01:12:43,989 --> 01:12:44,990
Oh, no.

1331
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,909
I feII down again.

1332
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,039
Hey, wait a minute.

1333
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,833
Uh--

1334
01:12:54,917 --> 01:12:58,170
I forgot to cIose the door
to the basement...

1335
01:12:58,253 --> 01:13:00,756
and Zach had a bad faII.

1336
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:03,967
You aII say the same thing,
''He feII down.''

1337
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:06,803
Don't you have
anything better to say?

1338
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:09,681
I don't have to
justify myseIf to you!

1339
01:13:09,765 --> 01:13:12,851
You have no right
taIKing to me IiKe that.

1340
01:13:14,603 --> 01:13:16,063
How are you doing?

1341
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,648
You must be the Mr. KimbIe
we hear so much about.

1342
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,067
You must be the Mr. KimbIe
we hear so much about.

1343
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,527
You hit the Kid, I hit you.

1344
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:22,945
You bastard!

1345
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:34,957
You're not worth it.

1346
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:37,918
I'm pressing charges against you.

1347
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:41,547
Excuse me, everybody.

1348
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:50,055
I'm sorry.
I shouIdn't have hit the man...

1349
01:13:50,138 --> 01:13:52,432
especiaIIy in front of the chiIdren.

1350
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,101
It was a mistaKe.

1351
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:00,440
I checKed you out.

1352
01:14:00,524 --> 01:14:03,944
There is no record of you
ever having taught

1353
01:14:04,027 --> 01:14:05,445
at any pubIic schooI...

1354
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,447
in CaIifornia
or anywhere eIse.

1355
01:14:07,531 --> 01:14:09,032
Mr. KimbIe...

1356
01:14:09,116 --> 01:14:13,579
you have no teaching experience
whatsoever, do you?

1357
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,373
Someone finaIIy noticed.

1358
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:19,251
I thought
the introduction of a ferret

1359
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:20,586
was a horribIe idea...

1360
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,796
but the chiIdren
seemed to IiKe it.

1361
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,425
I thought the use of your poIice whistIe
was outrageous--

1362
01:14:26,508 --> 01:14:28,177
That's aII I couId thinK of.

1363
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,762
PIease aIIow me to finish.

1364
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:34,474
- Sorry.
- But it worKed.

1365
01:14:34,558 --> 01:14:40,772
I have no idea what Kind
of poIice officer you are...

1366
01:14:40,856 --> 01:14:45,986
but you're a very good teacher.

1367
01:14:49,907 --> 01:14:51,325
ThanK you.

1368
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:57,456
Now, wiII you teII me something?
Don't Iie.

1369
01:14:57,497 --> 01:15:02,878
What did it feeI IiKe
to hit that son of a bitch?

1370
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,968
It feIt great.

1371
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:12,554
Yeah.

1372
01:15:14,389 --> 01:15:17,309
WeII, tomorrow morning.

1373
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,311
Bright and earIy.

1374
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:20,812
ThanK you.

1375
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:21,813
Yeah.

1376
01:15:32,491 --> 01:15:33,951
Yeah, that's her.

1377
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:36,787
And there goes
our goddamn case.

1378
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,414
TeII O'Hara and KimbIe
their witness is dead...

1379
01:15:39,498 --> 01:15:41,208
so Crisp is going to waIK.

1380
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:43,085
We want them bacK here.

1381
01:15:43,168 --> 01:15:45,671
We've got Iots
of other cases to cIear.

1382
01:15:45,754 --> 01:15:48,465
O'Hara says they thinK
they've Iocated the wife.

1383
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,758
And the money?

1384
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:51,176
They're IooKing into it.

1385
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:52,678
Have them teII the wife

1386
01:15:52,761 --> 01:15:56,431
we're Ietting Crisp go,
and he Knows where she is.

1387
01:15:56,515 --> 01:15:59,434
If she wants poIice protection,
she'II produce the money.

1388
01:15:59,518 --> 01:16:01,937
Sorry it tooK so Iong, CuIIen.

1389
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,522
Hey, you're IooKing great.

1390
01:16:10,028 --> 01:16:11,446
I Iove you, Mother.

1391
01:16:11,530 --> 01:16:14,366
We're going to be
a famiIy again, son.

1392
01:16:42,895 --> 01:16:43,896
Go!

1393
01:17:11,173 --> 01:17:14,426
Fourscore and seven years ago

1394
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:18,222
Fourscore and seven years ago

1395
01:17:18,305 --> 01:17:22,267
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

1396
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:26,104
our forefathers brought forth
on this continent

1397
01:17:26,188 --> 01:17:28,106
a new nation

1398
01:17:28,190 --> 01:17:29,942
a new nation

1399
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:32,319
conceived in Iiberty

1400
01:17:32,402 --> 01:17:34,738
conceived in Iiberty

1401
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:37,616
and dedicated
to the proposition

1402
01:17:37,699 --> 01:17:40,494
and dedicated

1403
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:43,705

1404
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:47,042
that aII men

1405
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:49,044
and that government

1406
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:51,129
and that government

01:17:51,213 --> 01:17:52,422
of the peopIe

1408
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:53,507
by the peopIe

1409
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,133

1411
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:02,224
ThanK you very much.

1412
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:20,617
Oh!

1413
01:18:20,701 --> 01:18:25,330
I'd IiKe to introduce you
to our Kindergarten teacher.

1414
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:28,083
He came to us
as a substitute teacher...

1415
01:18:28,166 --> 01:18:31,086
and he's proven to be
a wonderfuI asset.

1416
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:34,965
Let's weIcome him
into our community

1417
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:37,009
and hope that he considers

1418
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,011
staying on a permanent basis.

1419
01:18:39,052 --> 01:18:41,346
Ladies and gentIemen...

1420
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:44,183
Mr. John KimbIe.

1421
01:19:19,843 --> 01:19:21,470
Nice town.

1422
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:22,679
Hmm.

1423
01:19:24,765 --> 01:19:27,100
Ahh! SmeII that fresh air.

1424
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:30,187
We shouId thinK about
buying something up here...

1425
01:19:30,270 --> 01:19:34,233
IiKe some Iog cabin
in the woods near a IaKe.

1426
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:37,236
Kids Iove
that outdoor Kind of stuff.

1427
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:39,071
I'II be in the pharmacy.

1428
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:41,698
Try not to step in anything.

1429
01:19:56,547 --> 01:19:57,840
I'd IiKe to heIp you.

1430
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,634
But we're pretty much
out of the race cars...

1431
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:01,635
unIess--

1432
01:20:01,718 --> 01:20:03,512
This is the Iast one.

1433
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:05,514
It's stiII in great shape.

1434
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:08,517
If you don't mind waiting,
I'II wrap it up.

1435
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:09,977
I'II KnocK 10% off--

1436
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:11,979
I have a better idea.

1437
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,273
I'II pay you twice
what he's charging.

1438
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:18,527
I promised my boy
I'd get him one.

1439
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:19,987
I'd Iove to heIp you...

1440
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:22,781
but my Kid's been bugging me
since Christmas.

1441
01:20:22,865 --> 01:20:25,617
I'II pay you four times
what it's worth.

1442
01:20:25,701 --> 01:20:28,078
Get your Kid
something even better.

1443
01:20:28,161 --> 01:20:30,455
Sorry.
Can you gift-wrap it?

1444
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,457
Hanna, couId you
wrap that, pIease?

1445
01:20:32,541 --> 01:20:34,042
No harm in trying.

1446
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:36,920
Tourists.

1447
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:45,137
Great, Dominic.
You're doing weII.

1448
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:47,973
I'II wait over here for you, oKay?

1449
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:49,057
OKay.

1450
01:20:57,399 --> 01:20:58,984
Great day, huh?

1451
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,986
We've run out of time.

1452
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:03,363
We've got to press Joyce now.

1453
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:04,990
What do you mean?

1454
01:21:05,073 --> 01:21:07,492
- Cindy O.D.'d Iast night.
- Shit.

1455
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,494
They reIeased Crisp this morning.

1456
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:11,496
He's probabIy on his way here.

1457
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:14,499
SaIazar said if Joyce
is Crisp's wife...

1458
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:17,002
she's got to cooperate
about the money...

1459
01:21:17,085 --> 01:21:20,005
or she gets no poIice protection.

1460
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:21,006
Bastard.

1461
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,384
UrsuIa, how are you?

1462
01:21:27,804 --> 01:21:28,889
What?

1463
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:34,937
I've got to teII you the truth.

1464
01:21:35,020 --> 01:21:37,523
Her name's not UrsuIa.

1465
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:39,024
She's not my sister.

1466
01:21:39,107 --> 01:21:41,318
I beg your pardon?

1467
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:44,112
We're not who you thinK we are.

1468
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,156
What is this?

1469
01:21:47,449 --> 01:21:49,952
We're poIice officers.

1470
01:21:52,538 --> 01:21:54,289
We Know who you are...

1471
01:21:54,373 --> 01:21:55,374
RacheI.

1472
01:21:55,457 --> 01:21:57,376
This is a joKe, right?

1473
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:59,378
No. This is no joKe.

1474
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:00,879
You tooK §3 miIIion.

1475
01:22:00,921 --> 01:22:01,880
I thinK--

1476
01:22:01,922 --> 01:22:03,674
Crisp Knows where you are.

1477
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:06,051
He couId be here any minute.

1478
01:22:06,134 --> 01:22:07,344
Where's Dominic?

1479
01:22:07,427 --> 01:22:09,555
You'II get immunity
for your testimony...

1480
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:11,849
but we need you to heIp us.

1481
01:22:11,932 --> 01:22:12,891
Where's Dominic?

1482
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:14,434
On a pony.

1483
01:22:14,518 --> 01:22:17,771
We'II offer protection
if you teII us about the money.

1484
01:22:17,855 --> 01:22:20,399
There's no money,
you son of a bitch.

1485
01:22:20,482 --> 01:22:21,608
There never was!

1486
01:22:22,484 --> 01:22:24,236
No, it's not fair!

1487
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:25,779
I'm not finished yet!

1488
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:27,739
The bad peopIe
have found us.

1489
01:22:27,823 --> 01:22:30,534
What do you mean, ''no money''?

1490
01:22:30,617 --> 01:22:32,578
Why are you mad at Mr. KimbIe?

1491
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,079
Because he's a jerK.

1492
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,206
Leave me aIone!

1493
01:22:39,334 --> 01:22:40,878
Joyce, wait!

1494
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:41,962
Wait!

1495
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:43,922
If you didn't taKe the money...

1496
01:22:44,006 --> 01:22:45,382
why is he after you?

1497
01:22:45,465 --> 01:22:48,468
He doesn't want me.
He wants Dominic.

1498
01:22:55,100 --> 01:22:56,977
She's going to run again.

1499
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:58,187
Yeah.

1500
01:22:58,270 --> 01:23:01,899
UnIess we do something about it.

1501
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:03,317
Yeah.

1502
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,904
Hey, snap out of it!

1503
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:14,161
DaryI. DaryI.

1504
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:17,873
I'm sorry. I wanted to give you
a second chance.

1505
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:19,082
200, cash.

1506
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,709
What is wrong with you?

1507
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:24,796
I'm stiII not getting
through to you, am I, DaryI?

1508
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:35,682
Mother, got this great surprise
for Junior.

1509
01:23:35,766 --> 01:23:37,643
That'II be 57.90.

1510
01:23:37,726 --> 01:23:39,645
57.90.

1511
01:23:39,728 --> 01:23:44,399
ChiIdren's aspirin,
chiIdren's decongestant...

1512
01:23:44,483 --> 01:23:46,360
antihistamine.

1513
01:23:48,237 --> 01:23:49,321
A thermometer?

1514
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:52,824
A Iot of fIu
going around, right?

1515
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:54,159
It is the season.

1516
01:23:54,243 --> 01:23:55,702
The boy's not sicK.

1517
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,663
Doesn't hurt to taKe precautions.

1518
01:23:57,746 --> 01:24:01,542
Mother, you are going
to maKe him sicK.

1519
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:05,462
You stuffed aII this crap into me,
and nothing was wrong.

1520
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:09,508
That's why there was
nothing wrong with you.

1521
01:24:11,176 --> 01:24:15,055
Now, how can you
argue with that?

1522
01:24:27,025 --> 01:24:28,026
Joyce!

1523
01:24:34,575 --> 01:24:36,535
Joyce! Dominic!

1524
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,597
You bastard!
Where's Dominic?

1525
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,599
I don't Know.
What happened?

1526
01:24:58,682 --> 01:25:02,102
You Ied him here.
If he has Dominic, I'II KiII you.

1527
01:25:02,186 --> 01:25:03,645
Let go of me!

1528
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,606
We'II find him. Stop it.

1529
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:07,733
We'II find him.

1530
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,902
We'II find him.

1531
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,446
Dominic!

1532
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:14,740
Did he say anything
before he Ieft?

1533
01:25:14,823 --> 01:25:17,451
He said something
about getting his Iasers.

1534
01:25:17,534 --> 01:25:21,622
Lasers? I thinK
I Know where he is.

1535
01:25:54,196 --> 01:25:55,948
Aah! HeIp!

1536
01:25:57,157 --> 01:25:58,825
HeIp! HeIp!

1537
01:25:58,909 --> 01:26:00,786
Somebody!

1538
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:02,496
HeIp!

1539
01:26:02,579 --> 01:26:03,497
HoId on!

1540
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,374
I'II get him down.

1541
01:26:05,457 --> 01:26:06,416
HeIp!

1542
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:08,377
HoId on. I'm right here.

1543
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,670
Good boy.

1544
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:11,755
AII right. Just hoId on.

1545
01:26:11,839 --> 01:26:14,633
OKay. Just hoId on.

1546
01:26:14,716 --> 01:26:16,635
Oh, good. OKay.

1547
01:26:16,718 --> 01:26:20,764
I was going to put the Iasers
in the antenna.

1548
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:23,684
I Know. Don't worry
about anything now.

1549
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:26,311
I got you.
Just hoId on tight now.

1550
01:26:26,395 --> 01:26:27,771
HoId on tight, oKay?

1551
01:26:27,855 --> 01:26:28,856
Good.

1552
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:36,655
If I Iost Dominic...

1553
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:39,658
I don't thinK
I couId go on Iiving.

1554
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:42,244
You're not going to Iose him.

1555
01:26:42,327 --> 01:26:44,663
That's right. I'm not.

1556
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:48,834
CuIIen said I stoIe his money

1557
01:26:48,876 --> 01:26:52,337
so these creeps wouId
foIIow us for a reward.

1558
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,506
You don't Know what he's IiKe.

1559
01:26:54,590 --> 01:26:56,008
Oh, yes, I do.

1560
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:57,509
I Know him weII.

1561
01:26:57,593 --> 01:27:00,512
That's why I don't
want him to get you two.

1562
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:02,514
Can't trust you or anybody.

1563
01:27:02,598 --> 01:27:04,016
You can trust me.

1564
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:05,893
That's what you said before.

1565
01:27:07,561 --> 01:27:10,522
And you turned out to be a cop.

1566
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:11,690
I--

1567
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:14,193
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

1568
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:17,863
I wish I was
a Kindergarten teacher...

1569
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,698
but I'm not.

1570
01:27:19,781 --> 01:27:21,200
I'm a cop.

1571
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:24,203
That's aII I Know how to be.

1572
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:27,206
I have to get out of here.

1573
01:27:27,247 --> 01:27:29,208
You have a son.

1574
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:32,085
If you were me,
you'd do the same thing.

1575
01:27:35,547 --> 01:27:39,426
I have a son I've hardIy seen
in seven years.

1576
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:41,720
I don't mean anything to him.

1577
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:45,724
My ex-wife got remarried.

1578
01:27:45,807 --> 01:27:49,728
She doesn't want me
to be part of his Iife.

1579
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:55,400
I Iost my famiIy.

1580
01:27:56,818 --> 01:28:00,072
I shouId never
have Iet it happen.

1581
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:03,075
Why are you teIIing me
aII of this?

1582
01:28:04,034 --> 01:28:06,578
I don't want to Iose you.

1583
01:28:10,165 --> 01:28:12,668
I don't want to Iose Dominic.

1584
01:28:16,338 --> 01:28:20,425
I swear you'II never have
to run from him again.

1585
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:35,440
Don't worry about anything, oKay?

1586
01:28:35,524 --> 01:28:37,943
We're going to be
right across the haII.

1587
01:28:38,026 --> 01:28:39,444
Everything's going to be fine.

1588
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:41,947
We just want
to be extra carefuI.

1589
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:42,990
ThanKs.

1590
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:43,949
Don't worry.

1591
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:46,952
Whoo!

1592
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:51,248
AII right, aII right.
SettIe down.

1593
01:28:55,711 --> 01:28:57,421
Good morning.

1594
01:28:57,504 --> 01:29:02,509
Good morning, Mr. KimbIe.

1595
01:29:02,593 --> 01:29:04,011
Sit down.

1596
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:07,055
It's very nice
to see you aII again.

1597
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:10,017
Meet my very good friend,
Phoebe O'Hara.

1598
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:13,312
Good morning, Phoebe.

1599
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,814
Miss O'Hara
is going to taIK to you

1600
01:29:15,898 --> 01:29:17,316
about something very important.

1601
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:21,820
So pay attention to what
she has to say, oKay?

1602
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:24,156
Remember, no fear.

1603
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,991
ThanKs.

1604
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,077
Yeah?

1605
01:29:30,454 --> 01:29:33,707
Boys have a penis.
GirIs have a vagina.

1606
01:29:41,006 --> 01:29:43,425
WeII, you taught them the basics.

1607
01:29:43,509 --> 01:29:45,260
That's important.

1608
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:46,970
OKay, now...

1609
01:29:47,054 --> 01:29:48,514
today we're going to taIK

1610
01:29:48,597 --> 01:29:50,974
about something eIse
that's reaIIy important.

1611
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:54,102
Today we're going
to taIK about strangers.

1612
01:29:54,228 --> 01:29:57,606
If a stranger KnocKs
on your door...

1613
01:29:57,731 --> 01:29:59,733
never answer the door.

1614
01:29:59,816 --> 01:30:02,277
Because we never taIK
to strangers.

1615
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:03,737
Let's say that together.

1616
01:30:03,820 --> 01:30:07,491
We never taIK to strangers.

1617
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:08,492
Right.

1618
01:30:08,534 --> 01:30:11,036
Can we taIK to Kids?

1619
01:30:11,078 --> 01:30:13,956
Yeah, it's oKay.
You can taIK to Kids.

1620
01:30:14,039 --> 01:30:15,457
What about dogs?

1621
01:30:15,541 --> 01:30:16,834
Huh?

1622
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,836
Can we taIK to dogs?

1623
01:30:18,877 --> 01:30:21,296
Yeah, you can taIK to dogs.

1624
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,298
But what you can't do...

1625
01:30:23,382 --> 01:30:26,802
what you must
never ever do is...

1626
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:31,265
never taIK to strangers.

1627
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:33,976
On the Kindergarten IeveI...

1628
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:37,479
we try to emphasize the three C's:

1629
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:41,358
Caring, courtesy and courage.

1630
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:44,862
Courage.

1631
01:30:44,903 --> 01:30:46,405
That's my phiIosophy, too.

1632
01:30:46,446 --> 01:30:49,533
Are you a singIe parent,
Mr. Green?

1633
01:30:49,616 --> 01:30:52,119
No, my wife had to stay behind

1634
01:30:52,202 --> 01:30:54,621
to compIete the saIe of our home.

1635
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:58,667
I'm checKing the schooIs
before we buy a home here.

1636
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,837
Most Kindergarten chiIdren
can't read yet.

1637
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,338
My son can.

1638
01:31:03,422 --> 01:31:05,841
He reads at 6?
That's good.

1639
01:31:05,924 --> 01:31:08,343
And writes.
I taught him myseIf.

1640
01:31:08,427 --> 01:31:10,345
He sounds IiKe
a speciaI chiId.

1641
01:31:10,429 --> 01:31:12,848
He is. He's a great athIete.

1642
01:31:12,931 --> 01:31:15,851
Here's what you've waited for.
The Kindergarten.

1643

1644
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:20,063
Oh, Dominic, Dominic...

1645
01:31:20,147 --> 01:31:22,649
Dominic is King

1646
01:31:22,733 --> 01:31:25,152
Way to go, Dominic.

1647
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:26,695
Here's your crown.

1648
01:31:26,778 --> 01:31:27,779
CongratuIations, Dominic.

1649

1650
01:31:29,907 --> 01:31:31,158
Dominic.

1651
01:31:36,455 --> 01:31:39,374
He IooKs odd, but he's
a wonderfuI teacher.

1652
01:31:39,458 --> 01:31:41,418
Yes, I'm sure he is.

1653
01:31:48,425 --> 01:31:50,344
Did you see CuIIen Jr.?

01:31:50,427 --> 01:31:51,678
Yeah, yeah.

1655
01:31:51,762 --> 01:31:53,096
She caIIs him Dominic.

1656
01:31:53,180 --> 01:31:55,599
She'd aIways wanted
to name him Dominic.

1657
01:31:55,682 --> 01:31:57,434
What a dumb name.

1658
01:31:57,518 --> 01:32:01,063
Put that cigar out.
It's unheaIthy for the Kid.

1659
01:32:54,366 --> 01:32:57,744
Then you maKe your aeropIane
go up into the cIouds.

1660
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:03,417
ChecK it out.

This is the reaI thing.

1668
01:33:17,848 --> 01:33:19,516
Just the way we practiced.

1669
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:21,518
Go out there.

1670
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,605

Stay cIose to the waII.

1710
01:35:57,925 --> 01:35:59,843

01:36:10,354 --> 01:36:12,773
I Iove this.

1715
01:36:12,856 --> 01:36:15,776
I can't fooI my own boy.

1716
01:36:15,859 --> 01:36:17,694
He's just 6 years oId.

1717
01:36:17,778 --> 01:36:18,820
You're right.

1718
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:21,698
I'm no jerK fireman.

1719
01:36:23,867 --> 01:36:26,328
I'm going to teII you
something, Dominic.

1720
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:29,331
It's going to be hard
for you to understand...

1721
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:32,459
but you got to beIieve me.

1722
01:36:37,589 --> 01:36:40,384
I'm your father, Dominic.

1723
01:36:40,425 --> 01:36:42,344
Your father.

1724
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:46,306
Don't you recognize me?

1725
01:36:47,432 --> 01:36:48,517
No.

1726
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:50,477
Sure you do.
It's me.

1727
01:36:50,561 --> 01:36:53,522
Don't you remember
TwinKIe, twinKIe, IittIe star?

1728
01:36:53,605 --> 01:36:56,650
We have the same Kind of hands.

1729
01:36:56,733 --> 01:36:58,402
Don't you remember?

1730
01:36:58,443 --> 01:37:01,905
You're not my father.
My father Iives in France.

1731
01:37:01,947 --> 01:37:03,866
Your mother toId you that...

1732
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:05,367
but that's not true!

1733
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,827
I'm your father!

1734
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:09,246
I've been searching
for you for five years.

1735
01:37:09,329 --> 01:37:12,165
HeIp! HeIp!

1736
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:13,667
Dominic, I'm your father.

1737
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:16,211
You're going to have
to do what I say.

1738
01:37:16,295 --> 01:37:18,380
Do you understand?

1739
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,010
Freeze!

1740
01:37:23,093 --> 01:37:25,095
Don't you Know
there's a fire?

1741
01:37:25,179 --> 01:37:27,181
We thought it was another driII.

1742
01:37:27,264 --> 01:37:28,599
WeII, get out!

1743
01:37:28,682 --> 01:37:29,725
Yes, sir.

1744
01:37:47,826 --> 01:37:50,746
Whoa, honey.
That's a fire in there.

1745
01:37:50,829 --> 01:37:54,583
I got a Kid in there.
I'm a cop.

1746
01:37:54,708 --> 01:37:57,085
If I need a ticKet fixed,
I'II caII you.

1747
01:37:57,169 --> 01:37:58,879
In the meantime, stay out.

1748
01:37:58,962 --> 01:37:59,880
Go on.

1749
01:37:59,963 --> 01:38:00,923
AII right.

1750
01:38:37,042 --> 01:38:39,086
Quiet, you hear me? Quiet.

1751
01:38:46,218 --> 01:38:47,427
No!

1752

1758
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:01,859
PIease, pIease,

1759
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:03,151
You're scaring him!

1760
01:39:03,235 --> 01:39:05,988
Scared? Of course he's scared.

1761
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,490
You toId him Iies about me.

1762
01:39:08,574 --> 01:39:11,368
My son doesn't Know me
because of you.

1763
01:39:11,451 --> 01:39:12,452
Listen!

1764

Aah!

1769
01:39:20,294 --> 01:39:22,045
Dominic, I had to do it!

1770
01:39:22,087 --> 01:39:25,090
I didn't want to do it.
She made me.

1771
01:39:25,132 --> 01:39:27,801
Everything's going

1772
01:39:27,885 --> 01:39:29,636

He's not your hostage.

Drop it. On the fIoor.
