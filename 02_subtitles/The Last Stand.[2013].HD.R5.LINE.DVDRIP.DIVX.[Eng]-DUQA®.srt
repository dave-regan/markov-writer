6
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:15,177
I would not come to the game.

7
00:03:15,178 --> 00:03:17,090
Knew he did not want to drive 5 hours

8
00:03:17,149 --> 00:03:20,717
- to see a football game.
- I'm not the crowds arrived.

9
00:03:20,752 --> 00:03:24,220
Also have to have someone
here to maintain order.

10
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,362
- Go bowling?
- I'm undercover.

11
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:35,965
Course, Ray
You disguises himself very well.

12
00:03:36,146 --> 00:03:38,168
- See you on Sunday.
- Wait, wait.

13
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,177
And your car?

14
00:03:40,278 --> 00:03:44,681
- Are in wave of fire-fighters.
- Well, if you have a fire...

15
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,285
can get it.
But please carefully.

16
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,425
Asshole.

17
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,096
- Good morning, Sheriff.
- Good morning.

18
00:03:59,097 --> 00:04:00,397
- Good morning.
- Sheriff?

19
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:02,441
- It's a beautiful day.
- Yeah, for sure.

20
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,842
- Hi, Ray!
- Hi.

21
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:06,638
Almost did not recognize you
in civilian clothes.

22
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,139
It's my day off.

23
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,540
Going to be a quiet weekend.

24
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,479
- And no more huge omelettes.
- Okay, sheriff, but you like.

25
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,047
Yeah, but...

26
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,651
Thanks.

27
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:43,606
- What's up, friends?
- Hi

28
00:04:43,677 --> 00:04:45,223
vai, sheriff?

29
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
Truck outside is yours, no?

30
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,924
- What are you carrying?
- Parts car.

31
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:52,324
This.

32
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,943
We have to be in New Orleans tomorrow.

33
00:04:54,944 --> 00:04:58,056
- This is quite far from here, huh?
- If is.

34
00:04:58,857 --> 00:05:00,724
Account, please.

35
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:07,231
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

36
00:05:07,236 --> 00:05:08,795
Let's hit the road.

37
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:11,268
Right. Drive carefully.

38
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,537
Can leave.

39
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:21,177
- Thank you, sir!
- Thank you, friend.

40
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,621
So you wonder shoppers.

41
00:05:25,761 --> 00:05:27,996
Going to eat anything?

42
00:05:28,236 --> 00:05:30,032
- Sheriff?
- No.

43
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,756
No. Thank you, Christie.
I think I will.

44
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,127
Bye.

45
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,963
- Goodbye, Ray.
- Ya.

46
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:56,013
Ooops! Caramba!

47
00:05:56,336 --> 00:06:00,483
I just make another elephant in
ass, huh, guys?

48
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:04,988
It's my turn. Goes forth.

49
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,058
Wait! Beware of the recoil.
She does not know who is your 1st time.

50
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:10,960
- Gimme soon!
- Ok, go there.

51
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,652
Beauty.

52
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:26,674
- What the fuck?
- No, no, no!

53
00:06:27,946 --> 00:06:30,180
No, no! No, no!

54
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:33,850
Gimme that here! Gimme!

55
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,520
Let me see how it is.
Let me see.

56
00:06:38,737 --> 00:06:40,336
What?

57
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,128
- Is it broken? Do you think that is?
- It should be.

58
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,998
- Is it broken?
- It is!

59
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:50,333
Oh, shit! Sheriff.

60
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:54,003
I thought he was not working today
.

61
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,107
Okay.

62
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:02,212
Hey, Sheriff! How are you, man?
Good to see you.

63
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,031
Could you tell me why
most of my team

64
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:08,084
in here throwing a piece of meat?

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,620
Good afternoon, Ray.

66
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,961
- Has license for that gun?
- I have, here.

67
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,801
Why do not you get a towel?
Are dirtying his uniform.

68
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,027
And you! Get that piece of meat
hat.

69
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:28,993
Piece of meat?

70
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:32,142
Look at this! Gross! Thank you.

71
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,135
Here.

72
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:42,953
"Museum Dinkum Firearms and Weapons
History?"

73
00:07:42,981 --> 00:07:46,390
- That's it.
- Do you have a museum here?

74
00:07:46,391 --> 00:07:48,092
I have to prove income tax.

75
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,970
"Open every Monday
5th Mondays of the month, from 12h to 15h.

76
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,719
Bring the whole family."

77
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,501
Sorry.

78
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:01,539
Take there.

79
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,674
Ray, sorry.

80
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:06,877
Ray, we were just having fun.

81
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:10,446
Not have much to do in town
. He was the greatest boredom.

82
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:12,705
- We need to exercise.
- Really?

83
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:14,489
- It!
- I have something for you.

84
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,204
- Legal.
- Some truckers

85
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:19,412
stopped there in the city, and
not like to see me.

86
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:21,492
There's something wrong with them.

87
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,028
Check these plates for me.

88
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,264
- Spoke, boss.
- If you discover something

89
00:08:27,265 --> 00:08:29,257
sends pros patrollers.

90
00:08:29,386 --> 00:08:32,475
Look! You are saradão, Ray
are working out?

91
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,409
- I warned him about the recoil.
- Give me the drugs!

92
00:08:40,745 --> 00:08:44,347
And let me test
before I change my mind...

93
00:08:44,348 --> 00:08:45,848
and give you a fine.

94
00:09:05,804 --> 00:09:07,670
We encircled the area.

95
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,408
- Ok, are you all ready?
- We, boss.

96
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,543
- Loved.
- Uh... boss?

97
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,747
Creating farmer has a problem.

98
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:24,520
They cannot take care of a farmer?

99
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:29,893
Let me.

100
00:09:30,595 --> 00:09:32,529
Let's get it on

101
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,468
I speak with him.

102
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:42,638
Know I take very good care of
farmers.

103
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,590
Hello.

104
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:00,929
How are things going?

105
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,228
They would be much better if
he said what makes on my land!

106
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:07,731
My name is Burrell.

107
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:15,368
Look, I'm filming a commercial.

108
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:17,692
You must watch TV, no?

109
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:21,477
Their property would be perfect.

110
00:10:21,478 --> 00:10:22,788
What?

111
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,263
Get out of my property.

112
00:10:26,915 --> 00:10:31,396
The company for which I work
will pay good money.

113
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:35,780
- And you do not have to...
- Did you hear what I said?

114
00:10:39,486 --> 00:10:41,991
Do not you want at least...

115
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:45,493
hear my offer? No!

116
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:48,102
Want to hear mine?

117
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:55,163
Get out now, or I'll fill your ass
bullets.

118
00:10:55,164 --> 00:10:58,138
Oh, my uncle, is best
download this thing, huh?

119
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:00,172
Before shoot yourself in the foot.

120
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,643
We're just conversant...

121
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,202
No, the conversation ended.
Get out of here!

122
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,182
Okay.

123
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:18,224
The choice is yours.

124
00:11:18,766 --> 00:11:21,853
If you do not want to accept the silver...

125
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,481
so take lead!

126
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,708
Look, I was saying it is embarrassing

127
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:36,578
having to arrest the ex-boyfriend.

128
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,141
- And whose fault is that?
- Who Stole: you.

129
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:43,076
I wonder who is to blame
to be "ex".

130
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:45,686
- I do not want to talk about it now.
- Let's talk.

131
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:49,878
We were talking about something else
but actually was about it.

132
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:51,931
You have an analgesic there?

133
00:11:52,286 --> 00:11:54,465
Here is the infirmary.

134
00:11:54,939 --> 00:11:57,714
- Come on, what's yours, huh?
- Ay, caramba!

135
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:02,067
You had everything! He was smart,
popular, a great athlete.

136
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:04,802
Was almost
earning a full scholarship to college,

137
00:12:04,803 --> 00:12:07,031
if he had not screwed everything
wavering.

138
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:11,018
Wanting to discussing Okay, no?
I served my country in Iraq and Afghanistan.

139
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:14,225
We're not talking about war.
And yes you be stuck

140
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:16,360
- for drunk and disorderly.
- Why do you care </ p >

141
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,410
if we are not together?

142
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,975
Hi, Sarah.

143
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,564
And then, Frank?

144
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,954
How strange.

145
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:34,617
Hey, you guys are back together?

146
00:12:34,636 --> 00:12:36,144
- Maybe.
- No.

147
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,166
Need even leave you stuck here?

148
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:39,813
Yes!

149
00:12:40,821 --> 00:12:41,821
Why?

150
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,952
Because the boss said to leave it in chess
this weekend.

151
00:12:44,953 --> 00:12:46,854
Just so.

152
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:51,850
Here...

153
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,828
can show me how to check these boards?

154
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:02,402
Give me here!

155
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,469
Okay.

156
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:08,091
I will only do it once, you know?
Watch.

157
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,831
Hi, Ray

158
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,800
plate of the truck is clean.

159
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:37,121
Registration Nevada, and the
driver is such a Thomas Burrell.

160
00:13:37,176 --> 00:13:39,652
- With clean record.
- Legal.

161
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:42,543
- Good job.
- Thanks.

162
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:53,186
Well, I guess you did not come here just to
tell me this, do you?

163
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:03,427
I have to move on.

164
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:07,457
Go to somewhere that has
action where I can make a difference.

165
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,125
Like when you worked in the Narcotics
in LA

166
00:14:10,126 --> 00:14:13,129
I do not understand how
dropped everything to come here.

167
00:14:13,748 --> 00:14:17,150
The most exciting thing I've
done in the last 4 days was...

168
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:19,745
take a cat from a tree.

169
00:14:19,746 --> 00:14:23,476
- Yeah, Somerton has its charm.
- It may be.

170
00:14:23,511 --> 00:14:27,386
Is I never left here, and
'll go crazy if you do not leave.

171
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:37,471
Think you can help me
get a job in LA?

172
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:41,711
Los Angeles is not
ball with this whole no.

173
00:14:43,866 --> 00:14:45,454
Look...

174
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,556
I understand you want to change.

175
00:14:49,093 --> 00:14:52,387
You're young,
want to experience adventures.

176
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:55,751
At your age, all I wanted was to go to LA

177
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:57,735
wanted to be part of the action.

178
00:14:57,836 --> 00:14:59,633
But now...

179
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:04,011
looking back, I think
different.

180
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:09,962
But if that's what you want,
of course I'll help you.

181
00:15:24,366 --> 00:15:28,836
Morning.
Thanks for coming so quickly and so early.

182
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:31,589
This is a top secret operation.

183
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:36,357
In 45 seconds, it will take a
prisoner on death row.

184
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,735
This prisoner is Gabriel Cortez.

185
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:44,276
Cortez is the head of Cartel
cruellest since Pablo Escobar.

186
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:47,350
Let's make sure this guy
never see the light of day.

187
00:15:47,351 --> 00:15:49,603
Let go off the radar.

188
00:16:02,886 --> 00:16:04,599
Let's start.

189
00:16:44,127 --> 00:16:46,194
<i>Train keeping the alpha position.</i>

190
00:16:46,195 --> 00:16:48,752
<i>Awaiting release  to proceed.</i>

191
00:17:10,032 --> 00:17:12,360
Oh, no! My God!

192
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,633
Do not shoot yet!

193
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,980
Shoot!

194
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:48,074
Cease fire! Cease fire!

195
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:51,243
There rooftop! On the terrace!
Walk! Walk!

196
00:17:58,516 --> 00:18:01,867
- John, I will cover the alley!
- Okay Vai someone with her.

197
00:18:07,366 --> 00:18:09,061
Rescue by ladder,
and you come with me.

198
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:11,828
Turn off the elevators.
Rest guard the place.

199
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:13,573
Nobody comes, nobody goes out!

200
00:18:25,266 --> 00:18:27,273
Ready. Can go.

201
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,474
Walk, walk!

202
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:44,734
Continue! Continue!

203
00:18:58,214 --> 00:18:59,810
Here!

204
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,053
Air support: Avenue Edwood, 1167.

205
00:19:37,036 --> 00:19:39,061
Ready? Come on!

206
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,780
- Rescue, please.
- We have 2 officers wounded.

207
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,772
Cortez fled.

208
00:20:08,647 --> 00:20:10,130
Hey!

209
00:20:10,657 --> 00:20:12,711
Stop! FBI!

210
00:20:12,851 --> 00:20:14,982
Grab it! Grab it!

211
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,843
Stop!

212
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,148
Show hands! Do not move!

213
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,751
Revisit it.

214
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,840
Not him.

215
00:20:45,408 --> 00:20:47,021
Not he!

216
00:20:47,696 --> 00:20:49,802
Stop! FBI!

217
00:20:50,973 --> 00:20:52,852
Motherfucker!

218
00:21:03,272 --> 00:21:06,485
- McKay!
- Richards, is seeing something?

219
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:08,688
'S all quiet at the back entrance.

220
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:12,541
We are now checking the alley!

221
00:21:29,776 --> 00:21:31,511
John!

222
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:37,181
<i>Richards! Richards</i>

223
00:21:38,744 --> 00:21:40,377
<i>you hear me?</i>

224
00:21:41,456 --> 00:21:43,126
<i>Richards.</i>

225
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,909
No.

226
00:21:50,818 --> 00:21:52,875
You McKay is not?

227
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:58,672
Future dad, right?

228
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:04,166
Put the gun down.

229
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,271
Richards! Richards!

230
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:19,928
Officer down! Officer down!

231
00:22:25,936 --> 00:22:27,442
Shit!

232
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,745
- Is she? Is she?
- No.

233
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:41,000
Close each hangar in particular
airstrip within a radius of 150Km.

234
00:22:41,001 --> 00:22:42,879
- Even small.
- Go to work.

235
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,016
So begins soon!

236
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:46,779
Cheque entire building that has
a camera pointed at the street.

237
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:49,855
See if you can identify the license plate
.

238
00:22:57,786 --> 00:22:59,539
As he pay you?

239
00:23:06,335 --> 00:23:09,876
- He does not know what he's talking about.
- You think I'm sucker?

240
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,986
I look like a sucker?

241
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,039
Want me pegunte him that?

242
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,053
Not, ask why he's dressed like
.

243
00:23:16,055 --> 00:23:20,591
Why is with that outfit?
Why are you dressed like that?

244
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:32,819
He said it
supporter of the Dutch team.

245
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,908
- And what does this have to do?
- The soccer team.

246
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,652
Is wearing the team colours.

247
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,087
You're mocking
with my face, right?

248
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,915
Okay. I get into the game.

249
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:50,741
Country that the "Dutch" come from?

250
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:58,204
He said the arm is aching because you
grabbed him tightly.

251
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:01,328
He'd catch something.
I worried about my life.

252
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:04,536
I tried to hit you.
I should have hit harder.

253
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,754
This is bullshit.

254
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,508
Now you speak my language, is it?

255
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,644
If you understand Spanish,

256
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:14,239
know I was talking a lot of nonsense
.

257
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,841
Ok, trickster.

258
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,604
Who was in the street at 4 am?

259
00:24:18,605 --> 00:24:20,830
We're in Vegas, man!

260
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,090
Lord, we find something.

261
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:49,173
- Ray Owens. What?
- Hi, sheriff.

262
00:24:49,176 --> 00:24:51,667
Christie's . I woke you?

263
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:54,466
No, no. I was already awake.

264
00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:55,809
<i>What do you want?</i>

265
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,658
Is that... I got
to open the restaurant

266
00:24:58,689 --> 00:25:01,253
and milk had not been delivered yet
.

267
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:04,936
Is that really a police matter?

268
00:25:05,065 --> 00:25:08,590
Mr. Parson
always delivers fresh milk early.

269
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:10,716
<i>He wakes up very early, you know</i>

270
00:25:10,766 --> 00:25:13,813
<i>I do not care  milk. The movement is
bit on weekends.</i>

271
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:17,703
<i>But he was always punctual,
from what I remember.</i>

272
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:21,789
- I'm worried about him.
- Ever thought of calling him?

273
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:25,244
<i>That old fashioned and stubborn
has no phone.</i>

274
00:25:25,596 --> 00:25:27,375
Oh, yeah.

275
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,363
I forgot.

276
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,990
I fear he infracted. Sorry
him awake.

277
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:37,979
Is that... there was nobody here
and I did not know who to call.

278
00:25:38,096 --> 00:25:40,150
You acted correctly, Christie.

279
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:43,517
I'll send one of my assistants
there to look at it.

280
00:25:43,518 --> 00:25:45,161
- Okay?
- Thank you, Sheriff.

281
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,929
Okay. Goodbye.

282
00:25:49,477 --> 00:25:51,967
Cortez and his men dropped
a sedan white

283
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:54,452
and split into 2 different cars.

284
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,537
And right now,
think Cortez is in here.

285
00:25:58,538 --> 00:26:00,234
Stop right there!

286
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,955
- What car is this?
- Where's Mitchell? He understands.

287
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,948
- Mitchell! Come here!
- Lord?

288
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,902
Increase . Look.

289
00:26:12,903 --> 00:26:15,227
View . What car is this?

290
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:18,746
I think is a ZR-1.

291
00:26:19,136 --> 00:26:22,469
- And what the hell is a ZR-1?
- A Corvette ZR-1.

292
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,331
This one was modified
pras fairs cars.

293
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:26,635
Is a monster on wheels.

294
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:30,500
Appeared in everything
newspaper 2 days ago. It was stolen in LA.

295
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:35,315
Normally Corvettes have a 700 hp,
but this has more than 1,000.

296
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,884
We a psychopath in a Bat mobile.

297
00:26:39,547 --> 00:26:41,265
How do we stop this?

298
00:26:41,305 --> 00:26:43,105
Uh... exploding it?

299
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:46,109
And if you have a hostage inside?

300
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:54,666
Legal. Let's move to
Intelligence.

301
00:26:54,766 --> 00:26:57,217
This is the car that we seek.

302
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,560
<i>The car we're looking
is a modified Corvette ZR-1.</i>

303
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:05,264
I see the photo here.

304
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:07,817
Warning when I locate it.

305
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:15,588
Hi, officer.

306
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:17,058
Enabling and car documents.

307
00:27:17,059 --> 00:27:18,458
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:19,916 --> 00:27:21,761
My qualification...

309
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:27,133
and the car documents.

310
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,966
Is the Corvette!
I repeat: the Corvette!

311
00:28:56,306 --> 00:28:57,602
Then, Jerry...

312
00:28:57,796 --> 00:29:00,292
Easy, cowboy. Do not enter the yard
Parson unannounced.

313
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:02,488
Know how it is. Right?

314
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:05,665
Hey, Mr. Parson!
Jerry Bailey's!

315
00:29:05,666 --> 00:29:09,969
Only came to know the Lord, then
not shoot at us, okay?

316
00:29:12,926 --> 00:29:15,532
- Let's go around the back.
- Okay.

317
00:29:25,876 --> 00:29:27,541
Damn!

318
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,803
Cannot open.

319
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:38,264
Hey, genius, why not try
doors first?

320
00:29:46,646 --> 00:29:48,341
Mr. Parson?

321
00:29:51,236 --> 00:29:53,812
I'll look up there.
You search here.

322
00:30:46,336 --> 00:30:48,322
Cortez spent
breaking the barrier.

323
00:30:48,366 --> 00:30:51,205
But airports are closed.
Will not fly away.

324
00:30:51,608 --> 00:30:54,439
Want a lock here.
Nothing can pass.

325
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:56,957
What is he trying to do?

326
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,758
Pro Going south on 95?

327
00:30:58,986 --> 00:31:01,565
He thinks he's going to
Mexico, but will not get.

328
00:31:01,566 --> 00:31:04,029
- Why do not you get a helicopter?
- The ZR-1 is faster

329
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,074
than any helicopter.

330
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,799
It's more than that.

331
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:10,866
Cortez is the 3rd generation of leaders
cartel.

332
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:14,595
He thinks he's untouchable.
Is how his mind works.

333
00:31:15,236 --> 00:31:16,646
He wants to be at the helm.

334
00:31:16,647 --> 00:31:18,585
- Literally.
- How so?

335
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:21,583
Cortez pilot racing cars
since adolescence.

336
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:23,917
Father built a clue him in Sinaloa.

337
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:27,586
He flies on the professional circuit
South American with a nickname.

338
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:30,701
I saw him riding.
He's very good.

339
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,417
Silence. Silence!

340
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:46,356
- Here is Bannister.
- Are you having a good day?

341
00:31:46,483 --> 00:31:47,783
Tues.

342
00:31:47,784 --> 00:31:50,578
This can only end in 2 ways.
And you know what?

343
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:51,905
Glad to anyone.

344
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,719
<i>With this girl alive or dead?</i>

345
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,886
<i>Can I cut it into pieces
and send it by mail for you.</i>

346
00:31:58,887 --> 00:32:00,279
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

347
00:32:00,566 --> 00:32:03,033
've killed a federal agent,
Gabriel.

348
00:32:03,376 --> 00:32:06,816
If you kill one more, I guarantee that
not have nowhere to hide.

349
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:12,377
<i>Listen, how will you explain to parents
she had come home in bags?</i>

350
00:32:14,366 --> 00:32:16,493
<i>Is how we will be John:</i>

351
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,786
<i>Call your people back
and out of my way.</i>

352
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:21,870
<i>Or his agent was already.</i>

353
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,473
- Any option I like.
- Let me talk to her.

354
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:33,548
<i>Sorry, John. I screwed up.
Sorry.</i>

355
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:38,680
I'll get you this.
Okay? Do not worry.

356
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:43,385
If you try to stop me,
many people will die needlessly.

357
00:32:43,466 --> 00:32:45,707
<i>You choose how you will.</i>

358
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:49,614
Right now, I'm just a guy who left
for a spin.

359
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:58,584
- Will not give it to explode.
- Shut the fuck up!

360
00:33:04,166 --> 00:33:07,470
- Yes?
- Ray, we are the home of Parson.

361
00:33:07,505 --> 00:33:09,514
<i>Found his body.</i>

362
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,774
<i>He was murdered.</i>

363
00:33:22,807 --> 00:33:25,627
A positive identification:
ZR-1-gray metallic

364
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,028
followed by U.S. Interstate-95.

365
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:33,576
<i>We can see the hostage
in the vehicle.</i>

366
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,152
- You are almost there, chief.
- Understood.

367
00:33:37,253 --> 00:33:39,474
Relax. We are ready this guy.

368
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:43,033
<i>Not trust either.
Cortez can always surprise.</i>

369
00:33:43,166 --> 00:33:45,086
<i>Need to be alert.</i>

370
00:33:45,112 --> 00:33:48,579
And remind your men
who has a hostage in the car.

371
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:52,661
Arriving at the Arizona border.
Should get soon.

372
00:33:53,137 --> 00:33:55,630
Understood.
Are all in position.

373
00:34:00,486 --> 00:34:03,135
5 minutes. Walk.

374
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:12,709
Fix up.
Want you to have a good view of the show.

375
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:14,457
What?

376
00:35:03,446 --> 00:35:05,350
Back!

377
00:35:53,316 --> 00:35:54,924
My God!

378
00:36:00,624 --> 00:36:02,785
<i>He went through all barriers.</i>

379
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,365
<i>Looks like a war zone down there
.</i>

380
00:36:04,366 --> 00:36:06,036
<i>Has targeted several police.</i>

381
00:36:06,037 --> 00:36:07,772
Damn!

382
00:36:11,486 --> 00:36:12,986
I'm already on the way.

383
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:15,187
And do not forget:
This is a crime scene.

384
00:36:15,188 --> 00:36:17,908
Not touch anything.

385
00:36:19,766 --> 00:36:21,416
Understood, sir.

386
00:36:26,986 --> 00:36:30,506
Is the following: we have a
broken window, ok?

387
00:36:30,507 --> 00:36:33,215
In my opinion,
was a robbery that went wrong.

388
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:37,435
I wonder what made Parson:
He came and surprised them.

389
00:36:37,536 --> 00:36:39,168
It may have been that.

390
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:44,222
Has anyone checked the tire marks?

391
00:36:44,386 --> 00:36:46,678
They came here first.

392
00:36:48,986 --> 00:36:51,052
- I'll check.
- Go with him.

393
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:52,549
Yes, sir.

394
00:36:54,276 --> 00:36:57,169
- Show me the body.
- Right here.

395
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:02,747
Oh, Jesus!

396
00:37:12,436 --> 00:37:14,533
No burn in drilling.

397
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:18,967
The bullet went through him.

398
00:37:24,746 --> 00:37:27,216
There was a gun that did it.

399
00:37:32,966 --> 00:37:34,836
Know which way did they go?

400
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,747
Direct pro canyon. Come.

401
00:37:50,556 --> 00:37:54,840
$ 3 million in an account in Switzerland as
combine.

402
00:37:56,326 --> 00:38:01,274
Know, in my country the police
say "gracias" after being paid.

403
00:38:06,166 --> 00:38:08,806
Has even driving like a maniac?

404
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,174
I can stop pretending I
hostage now?

405
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:19,454
Ooops! Sorry.

406
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:34,284
What is this?

407
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:38,042
- Adrenaline!
- What?

408
00:38:41,961 --> 00:38:45,095
Lost eye contact!
He just disappeared!

409
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:49,023
- How? Give back!
- Let's look around.

410
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:22,032
He's gone!

411
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:24,375
How so "disappeared"?
Keep looking!

412
00:39:24,576 --> 00:39:27,500
Has to continue! Look! Find it!

413
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:32,265
<i>We lost him. Keep looking.</i>

414
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:33,866
Bastard!

415
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:55,817
He killed out here, and then took the body
inside.

416
00:39:58,176 --> 00:40:00,149
How long he arrives at the border?

417
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,055
That speed between 65 and 75 minutes.

418
00:40:03,366 --> 00:40:07,535
Shortcut that he is taking
canyon is most of the time.

419
00:40:07,586 --> 00:40:09,834
Can increase this to me, please
?

420
00:40:10,986 --> 00:40:13,361
The intercept point is here:
Los Algodones.

421
00:40:13,362 --> 00:40:15,466
I know the police chief
that border.

422
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:17,046
It's kind of tough.

423
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:19,543
And the passage
was reformed last year.

424
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:23,507
Concrete walls pure
retractable steel barriers on the ground.

425
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:24,708
Is a fortress.

426
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,911
Cortez would not
behind a target without a plan of action.

427
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:29,818
Whatever plan will be prepared.

428
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:33,309
Email people to Algodones.
Reinforce passage.

429
00:40:33,486 --> 00:40:35,545
Right. And what do you think of this city?

430
00:40:35,657 --> 00:40:37,502
Somerton Junction.

431
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,859
Not have an official pass.

432
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:42,306
But the point closest to the road.

433
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:44,533
Wait.

434
00:40:45,716 --> 00:40:47,941
The ravine is too deep to cross
.

435
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:51,266
Is unlikely.
But let's not ignore that.

436
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,271
I'll call the sheriff.

437
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,652
Say that out of the way.

438
00:40:59,586 --> 00:41:01,686
- Hello?
- Sheriff Owens?

439
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:04,435
- Myself. Who is this?
- John Bannister, the FBI.

440
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,489
- We have a problem.
- Can talk.

441
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:09,430
Has a fugitive following
to the Mexican border.

442
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:12,680
There is a small chance he
try to cross it by Somerton Junction.

443
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:17,305
Is more likely than not try, but
I will send a SWAT a precaution.

444
00:41:17,306 --> 00:41:19,581
No offense, but they only
can handle it.

445
00:41:19,582 --> 00:41:22,358
Cannot talk now. I got to go.

446
00:41:25,206 --> 00:41:26,632
What?

447
00:41:27,956 --> 00:41:29,557
I do not know.

448
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:33,757
The FBI says a fugitive
may be coming our way.

449
00:41:34,197 --> 00:41:37,414
Seriously? So we have action!

450
00:41:38,966 --> 00:41:41,420
This is no coincidence.

451
00:41:41,828 --> 00:41:45,135
First the guys in the cafeteria,
now this.

452
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,688
The two things are connected.

453
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:50,713
We have to talk with Bailey and Torrance.

454
00:41:59,696 --> 00:42:01,337
Shit!

455
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,988
What light is that?

456
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:05,940
Will they?

457
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,923
Think they are so stupid
to stay here?

458
00:42:10,516 --> 00:42:12,914
Devils. Give me the gun.

459
00:42:14,736 --> 00:42:16,818
Stop the car! Stop!

460
00:42:25,316 --> 00:42:27,084
What the fuck?

461
00:42:27,536 --> 00:42:29,501
<i>Bailey and Torrance,
where are you?</i>

462
00:42:32,536 --> 00:42:35,615
Follow some tire brands up the canyon
on the side south of the city.

463
00:42:35,616 --> 00:42:38,370
Has anyone here.
We are going to check the foot.

464
00:42:38,371 --> 00:42:41,865
Negative. Go back
immediately. Got it?

465
00:42:42,316 --> 00:42:44,080
Gimme that.

466
00:42:53,725 --> 00:42:58,049
Ray, have lights on.
Has something big going on here!

467
00:43:00,986 --> 00:43:03,231
Ray, are you listening?

468
00:43:04,121 --> 00:43:05,871
Ray, are you listening?

469
00:43:11,357 --> 00:43:12,869
Stop!

470
00:43:25,736 --> 00:43:27,519
Jerry, run!

471
00:43:39,436 --> 00:43:41,279
- Sarah!
- Go!

472
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:55,226
<i>What the hell is happening here?</i>

473
00:43:57,606 --> 00:44:00,447
They're shooting at us!
Are many!

474
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,816
<i>We're coming!</i>

475
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,512
Night Vision.

476
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,371
Lights out. Now.

477
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:30,217
Shit!

478
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:43,383
Jerry, are you legal?
Can you come here?

479
00:44:46,536 --> 00:44:48,210
I can!

480
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:50,493
Wait!

481
00:46:04,753 --> 00:46:07,620
- Jerry is there! He was shot!
- I'll cover you!

482
00:46:07,621 --> 00:46:09,016
Ok!

483
00:46:13,306 --> 00:46:15,815
Use the missile launcher!

484
00:46:21,118 --> 00:46:23,766
Jerry, we got to go! Come on!

485
00:46:35,655 --> 00:46:37,282
Vai, vai, vai!

486
00:47:03,168 --> 00:47:06,566
- Is anyone following us?
- Negative, I'm not seeing headlights.

487
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:07,989
Great.

488
00:47:08,415 --> 00:47:09,552
Are you okay?

489
00:47:09,553 --> 00:47:11,361
Oh, God, Jerry!
's Still bleeding.

490
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,325
It's nothing serious.

491
00:47:13,326 --> 00:47:15,881
Find the wound and apply pressure.

492
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:21,436
Sorry. 'S Alright, alright.

493
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:25,730
Take care. Blood stains are difficult
out of uniform.

494
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:29,913
Think I'm calling? Are you
vai even wash it after...

495
00:47:30,236 --> 00:47:32,188
we'll mend.

496
00:47:33,078 --> 00:47:35,875
Think Frank will be jealous if
see us like this?

497
00:47:35,876 --> 00:47:40,311
You can talk to your colleague
he is losing his time.

498
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,545
I do not go to prison.

499
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:44,979
Yeah, he likes you.

500
00:47:46,606 --> 00:47:49,325
Hang on, Jerry. Please.

501
00:47:49,584 --> 00:47:52,622
Jerry! Hang on, Jerry.

502
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,822
Ray, run!

503
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,503
Jerry...

504
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,927
- Come on.
- Oh, Ray ..

505
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:48,366
Ah, Jerry...

506
00:49:33,286 --> 00:49:34,830
Sarah!

507
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:37,773
Sarah!

508
00:49:46,827 --> 00:49:49,404
Not believe he is dead.

509
00:49:53,526 --> 00:49:55,805
He was talking about you...

510
00:49:56,686 --> 00:49:59,387
just before he died.

511
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,166
And what did he say?

512
00:50:04,636 --> 00:50:07,639
Asked me to go easy on you.

513
00:50:09,183 --> 00:50:11,791
That you're not so bad.

514
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:32,635
As well "gave police work"?

515
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,456
- What kind of work?
- Listen...

516
00:50:34,457 --> 00:50:36,441
will be ready on time?

517
00:50:36,442 --> 00:50:38,624
Yes, you will not have problem.

518
00:50:38,822 --> 00:50:41,236
I just hope
fulfill its mission.

519
00:50:41,237 --> 00:50:43,936
I do not care any more excuses.

520
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:46,947
Shit!

521
00:50:49,006 --> 00:50:52,035
Bannister talking. How long will it take
the SWAT team?

522
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,835
45 minutes. Why?

523
00:50:53,936 --> 00:50:55,236
<i>Because I need help.</i>

524
00:50:55,237 --> 00:50:57,778
Your prisoner is trying
to cross the border here.

525
00:50:57,779 --> 00:50:59,523
What are you talking about?
Hence it does not.

526
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:00,824
<i>Are giving a way.</i>

527
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:03,086
Because the canyon, in the southern part,
is very narrow.

528
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:06,124
Has a full staff there with
military experience heavy weapons.

529
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:08,691
They're building a bridge over the Mobile
canyon!

530
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:11,975
- Really? You think?
- I know. I saw those guys.

531
00:51:11,976 --> 00:51:14,316
Exchanged shots with them!

532
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:16,695
<i>Who the hell is this fugitive, eh?</i>

533
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:21,609
- Gabriel Cortez.
- What?

534
00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:23,835
<i>And why did not you tell me this before
?</i>

535
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:26,716
My cop would still be alive if I knew that
!

536
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:29,636
Not have time to explain every detail
.

537
00:51:29,637 --> 00:51:31,873
Why not give a saucy to patrol?

538
00:51:31,874 --> 00:51:35,892
Look, I do not know you, nor am
and his subordinate!

539
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,975
Motherfucker!

540
00:51:43,086 --> 00:51:45,527
Hung up on me.

541
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,372
Sheriff psychotic.

542
00:51:47,516 --> 00:51:50,695
Phil, call the SWAT captain.
Now.

543
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:54,554
And get me a map of Somerton.
I want to see something.

544
00:51:58,405 --> 00:52:00,509
- Mr.
- Captain, has a chance...

545
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:03,416
of the Cortez for trying to cross
Somerton.

546
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:06,335
<i>When you get there, if you feel
destroy a bridge.</i>

547
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:07,990
Yes, sir.

548
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:20,433
A movable bridge...

549
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,712
SWAT is there front.
What will you do?

550
00:52:31,476 --> 00:52:34,280
Death does not arrive when you expect.

551
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,776
Piloting a race car...

552
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:39,656
or in a shootout...

553
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:45,803
Death awaits in the kitchen when you lift
night

554
00:52:45,804 --> 00:52:47,843
to get a glass of milk.

555
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:56,108
My niece,
the oldest of my sister,

556
00:52:56,109 --> 00:52:57,812
was a good girl.

557
00:52:57,936 --> 00:52:59,961
I practically raised her.

558
00:53:00,754 --> 00:53:03,365
Then one night,
I bumped into her in the kitchen

559
00:53:03,366 --> 00:53:05,166
me a gun.

560
00:53:07,586 --> 00:53:10,092
If she had not wavered, my brain would

561
00:53:10,136 --> 00:53:14,318
there scattered across the kitchen floor
and not hers.

562
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:30,394
Shit!

563
00:53:57,886 --> 00:54:01,549
Do not try to see death coming, because
not see.

564
00:54:13,365 --> 00:54:15,491
SWAT will not arrive.

565
00:54:16,236 --> 00:54:17,978
We're on our own?

566
00:54:18,096 --> 00:54:21,236
So who is going to stop this guy
Cortez?

567
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:25,327
This problem is the feds.
He was in their custody.

568
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:29,217
They is the guy who lost.
Should not be our problem.

569
00:54:33,466 --> 00:54:35,095
Maybe not.

570
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:40,755
But if it passes through our city,
is our problem, yes.

571
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:46,170
But... We can close our eyes.
Let's do this.

572
00:54:48,405 --> 00:54:51,885
If we do,
is better playing off the badge.

573
00:54:51,886 --> 00:54:53,654
Ray, come on.

574
00:54:54,906 --> 00:54:56,548
Cannot.

575
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,450
Jerry died because of that guy.

576
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,742
Ray, you know me.
I'm not a coward.

577
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:19,151
I'd love to pick a fight with those guys
by Jerry.

578
00:55:19,404 --> 00:55:24,025
But Cortez is much for us.
He has an army.

579
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:31,592
Look,

580
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:35,601
if you want to leave this,
's okay by me.

581
00:55:35,736 --> 00:55:37,935
I will not criticize them for that.

582
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:43,791
But I will not let this guy
enter our city without fighting.

583
00:55:47,758 --> 00:55:50,445
I also took an oath, Ray.

584
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,780
Ray, it seems you are needing help
.

585
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,905
I can help you.

586
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,722
Your aim is still good as it was?

587
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:22,147
Military
memory lasts a long time.

588
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,461
Frank, I've seen many
you start things and not finish.

589
00:56:26,478 --> 00:56:28,181
Jerry was my friend.

590
00:56:28,382 --> 00:56:30,913
I would never abandon my friends.

591
00:56:33,261 --> 00:56:35,150
Can release it.

592
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,708
You will be my helper.

593
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:42,079
I will not disappoint you.

594
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:53,673
Okay, okay.

595
00:56:54,493 --> 00:56:57,826
Now we are four. Are you happy?

596
00:57:15,329 --> 00:57:16,877
Phil...

597
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:20,536
want financial information from all
Division.

598
00:57:20,537 --> 00:57:22,915
Even mine. No exceptions.

599
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:27,897
Cortez have someone here that
warned him about his transfer.

600
00:57:27,898 --> 00:57:30,385
I wonder who is. Right?

601
00:58:08,775 --> 00:58:10,331
Ray, I...

602
00:58:12,364 --> 00:58:14,576
I want to tell you something:

603
00:58:14,677 --> 00:58:17,797
When I was with Jerry
in the middle of shooting,

604
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,458
I was terrified.

605
00:58:20,966 --> 00:58:25,281
I could not get my hands to stop shaking.

606
00:58:25,381 --> 00:58:27,238
Look, this is normal.

607
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:30,254
Everyone is so
in the middle of a firelight.

608
00:58:37,084 --> 00:58:39,722
I'll tell you a secret:

609
00:58:42,773 --> 00:58:46,701
Probably I'm more afraid than you
this time.

610
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,602
What?

611
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,707
But why?

612
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:54,804
Because I've seen a lot of blood and death.

613
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:58,262
I know what's going to happen.

614
00:59:17,675 --> 00:59:20,276
Ask Washington to send
an image in real time

615
00:59:20,330 --> 00:59:22,809
the region around Somerton.

616
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,607
If the sheriff is right,

617
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:26,966
have 100 federal agents idly

618
00:59:26,967 --> 00:59:30,070
bordering Los Algodones
are blurring without reason.

619
00:59:30,181 --> 00:59:33,282
- What is the fastest way?
- A Challenger jet.

620
00:59:33,905 --> 00:59:35,316
Make.

621
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:37,839
Ready?

622
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,828
Yes, but let's face like everyone
firepower

623
00:59:40,847 --> 00:59:43,178
with a pair of shotguns?

624
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,103
I have an idea.

625
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:56,356
I have two conditions that must accept
before I do anything.

626
00:59:56,500 --> 01:00:00,060
- Sing it.
- I want to be a cop like Frank.

627
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:02,800
Thus any damage caused to me or that I
cause,

628
01:00:02,863 --> 01:00:04,760
will be responsibility of the police force

629
01:00:04,761 --> 01:00:07,135
and Sheriff Somerton Junction.

630
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,789
Put your hand here.

631
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:18,865
I nominate this instant
Dinkum Lewis,

632
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:21,304
to be assistant sheriff
from this day,

633
01:00:21,405 --> 01:00:23,637
or until their services
are no longer needed

634
01:00:23,638 --> 01:00:25,530
the people of Somerton Junction.

635
01:00:25,677 --> 01:00:27,639
- Witnesses?
- I witness.

636
01:00:32,526 --> 01:00:34,613
- What else?
- Huh?

637
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,625
Second condition.

638
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,986
I want to take the "Georgette".

639
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,630
I'm the only one who knows how to use it.

640
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:43,167
Okay. Come on.

641
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,199
You can also use it, Ray
And you, Frank.

642
01:00:47,395 --> 01:00:49,161
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

643
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:57,329
- Jesus Christ, Lewis!
- Caramba!

644
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,443
What a beauty!
Where'd you get that?

645
01:01:01,446 --> 01:01:04,067
"Vicky"? She is my
killer-of-Nazis.

646
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:06,447
Vickers Machine Gun 1939.

647
01:01:06,605 --> 01:01:08,661
Is my "bitch-doidinha."

648
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,812
it cannot legally be used.

649
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:16,677
But I put back the missing pieces
and theoretically it works.

650
01:01:16,678 --> 01:01:20,494
Course this is between us and God.
Uncle Sam does not need to know.

651
01:01:20,705 --> 01:01:23,271
- Has more ammunition?
- Some cartridges.

652
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,176
So bring everything you have.

653
01:02:02,378 --> 01:02:04,984
Did
think will fight in a Crusade?

654
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,563
Never know.

655
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,425
We meet in the main street
in 5 minutes.

656
01:02:25,426 --> 01:02:28,641
Cars also need to do the blocking.

657
01:02:28,642 --> 01:02:30,741
I drive the old "Henrietta" here.

658
01:02:30,742 --> 01:02:32,624
Why idiots
gives nicknames for everything?

659
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,680
Only for things that I love.

660
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:37,716
Come on.

661
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,128
Okay. I inform after landing.

662
01:02:53,243 --> 01:02:54,243
Upgrade me.

663
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:57,339
Border patrol responded,
but it will take 1 hour to arrive.

664
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:59,305
- And the National Guard?
- More time yet.

665
01:02:59,306 --> 01:03:01,829
- And the Army?
- Only authorizes the president.

666
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:03,576
We only have 45 minutes.

667
01:03:20,194 --> 01:03:23,861
Cortez will have to go through
main street to get to the canyon.

668
01:03:23,896 --> 01:03:26,265
The only other option is
by Alzamora St.

669
01:03:26,266 --> 01:03:29,204
Torrance, vai with Frank and Lewis
and lock it.

670
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,370
"Figue"
and I'll warn civilians.

671
01:03:31,490 --> 01:03:32,871
Understood.

672
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,296
- Hi, Ray.
- Listen, my friends...

673
01:03:37,546 --> 01:03:39,853
a fugitive
is coming to our city.

674
01:03:40,563 --> 01:03:41,989
Is very dangerous to stay here.

675
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,951
I want everyone go home!

676
01:03:48,655 --> 01:03:50,797
You heard what I said?

677
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:56,759
- Just ask the coffee!
- It's for safety of you.

678
01:03:56,936 --> 01:04:00,130
You are talking to a 72 year old
with high cholesterol,

679
01:04:00,185 --> 01:04:02,401
eating bacon and cheddar omelette with.

680
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:05,146
You really think I'm afraid of death?

681
01:04:06,292 --> 01:04:09,839
Not look at me.
I asked the same thing.

682
01:04:11,572 --> 01:04:13,446
Already started preparing.

683
01:04:14,943 --> 01:04:17,898
- Where's Christie?
- Was behind milk.

684
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:24,683
So stay away from windows,
okay?

685
01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:29,356
- Stay away from windows.
- Right. No windows.

686
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:33,457
So, what do we do?

687
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:36,034
Is: put your truck back there

688
01:04:36,035 --> 01:04:38,547
and find more people to use cars.

689
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,241
- I have a better idea.
- Need something bigger.

690
01:04:42,787 --> 01:04:46,280
Maybe three on this side.
Should be enough.

691
01:04:48,812 --> 01:04:50,149
Hey!

692
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,717
- What will you do?
- Clear!

693
01:04:52,867 --> 01:04:54,365
Not do that!
E electrical wires?

694
01:04:54,494 --> 01:04:57,859
Are phone and cable TV!
Electricity is back there!

695
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,333
That's not what I'm talking about!
If you cut the pole

696
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,933
he'll be hanging only by the wires
!

697
01:05:10,874 --> 01:05:14,094
"Geronimo!" "Geronimo!"

698
01:05:20,747 --> 01:05:22,159
Perfect!

699
01:05:22,964 --> 01:05:24,660
Let's put the cars here.

700
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:27,119
What crap!

701
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:30,823
Caramba!

702
01:05:32,442 --> 01:05:34,739
- John, you better look at it.
- What is it?

703
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:36,575
Satellite image
National Security.

704
01:05:36,576 --> 01:05:39,589
This is a live picture of the canyon
Somerton south of Junction.

705
01:05:39,784 --> 01:05:41,084
Check it out.

706
01:05:41,158 --> 01:05:42,958
- It's a bridge.
- Is.

707
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:45,421
Not believe.

708
01:05:46,802 --> 01:05:49,617
The sheriff was right.
Who is he?

709
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:53,770
In 1988, came to LAPD

710
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:55,862
trained with the elite tactical team
.

711
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:57,973
Narcotics worked in 5 years, and then left
.

712
01:05:58,272 --> 01:05:59,272
Why?

713
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:02,117
He took a group that moved
half a ton of cocaine.

714
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:06,175
Won a medal for bravery, but
took 5 shots.

715
01:06:06,425 --> 01:06:09,059
He survived, but another 7
not police.

716
01:06:09,294 --> 01:06:11,072
Was the last straw pro Owens.

717
01:06:11,107 --> 01:06:13,089
He saw much bloodshed
and wanted to leave.

718
01:06:13,121 --> 01:06:15,596
Somerton was to play sheriff.

719
01:06:19,786 --> 01:06:21,262
Thanks.

720
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:24,940
Yeah, we need two more.

721
01:06:25,052 --> 01:06:27,553
Oh my God!
What are you doing now, Dinkum?

722
01:06:27,648 --> 01:06:29,678
Once you crazy?

723
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,495
Easy there! Almost there!

724
01:06:33,961 --> 01:06:35,650
Dinkum, do not!

725
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,882
Dinkum! Dinkum! You okay?

726
01:06:41,743 --> 01:06:44,346
Oh, my God! You okay?

727
01:06:46,543 --> 01:06:48,016
Henrietta!

728
01:06:49,624 --> 01:06:51,239
Worked!

729
01:06:53,363 --> 01:06:56,244
Good work police. Good job.

730
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:10,035
Ray, we need something bigger.

731
01:07:11,134 --> 01:07:12,529
I have an idea.

732
01:07:12,655 --> 01:07:14,913
- Torrance.
- The street is blocked.

733
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:18,291
Great. Speech and pro Dinkum Martinez
find me in the schoolyard.

734
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:22,259
And I want you on the roof of the old hotel
to be my lookout.

735
01:07:22,765 --> 01:07:26,044
Figue, go to the southern part
check if the buildings are empty.

736
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:28,057
- I'll be right back.
- I'm going.

737
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,975
Come "kicking a dead horse."

738
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:07,446
Ai, caramba!

739
01:08:25,737 --> 01:08:28,165
You guys
on Main Street travelling south.

740
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:30,576
<i>Not the face.
Wait till we get there.</i>

741
01:08:30,677 --> 01:08:32,215
Understood, Ray.

742
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:53,060
But that hell is that?

743
01:08:54,723 --> 01:08:56,750
This will be fun!

744
01:08:57,662 --> 01:09:00,312
I need two men on the left ...

745
01:09:01,511 --> 01:09:03,194
and 2 on the right.

746
01:09:05,331 --> 01:09:08,526
You can shoot anything that moves
.

747
01:09:08,887 --> 01:09:12,185
If you do not move, shoot it anyway
!

748
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:19,337
And when we finish, we'll burn this place
!

749
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:37,547
- Christie! Christie!
- By God, Figue!

750
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:39,443
Christie, you got to get out of here now
!

751
01:09:39,478 --> 01:09:42,675
What is happening?
Why are these cars so?

752
01:09:42,866 --> 01:09:44,857
Look at that ass.

753
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:49,089
Christie,
you have to get out of the street!

754
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,883
Why is hidden behind the car?

755
01:09:50,884 --> 01:09:53,237
This one is my kind of woman.

756
01:09:54,707 --> 01:09:56,221
Damn!

757
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:02,722
Vai! Vai!

758
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,164
Run!

759
01:10:04,665 --> 01:10:06,781
Come! Get down!

760
01:10:08,157 --> 01:10:09,543
How is it? Shoot!

761
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:11,814
Restaurant...
pro Vai restaurant!

762
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:19,709
Shit!

763
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:21,558
Is the best that shoots?

764
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:40,332
Look at the sucker big hat.

765
01:10:40,513 --> 01:10:43,471
This is getting boring.
Bring the missile launchers!

766
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:46,633
Oh, damn. Damn!

767
01:10:49,470 --> 01:10:52,477
This . Let's give him a souvenir
.

768
01:10:55,689 --> 01:10:57,483
Oh, shit!

769
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:38,957
Get him!

770
01:11:40,624 --> 01:11:42,496
- Damn!
- Figue!

771
01:11:46,061 --> 01:11:47,579
All clear. Vai.

772
01:12:02,429 --> 01:12:04,366
What is happening?

773
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,623
- Torrance, okay?
- I'm, Ray.

774
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:12,958
But hit the Figue.

775
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,005
What is this shit?

776
01:13:33,246 --> 01:13:35,312
Welcome to Somerton Junction.

777
01:13:38,795 --> 01:13:40,830
Beautiful shots, sheriff.

778
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:49,426
Placed in position this bus!

779
01:13:51,117 --> 01:13:54,174
- Hurry!
- Coming! Let's do this!

780
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,210
Hurry up!

781
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,919
We are positioned!

782
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:19,254
Torrance!
From where the shots are coming?

783
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,641
Behind you!
The side of the restaurant!

784
01:14:23,955 --> 01:14:26,175
- Give me cover!
- "Linger"!

785
01:14:42,997 --> 01:14:44,769
How are you, sheriff?

786
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,746
Old.

787
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,869
No, you still have very ahead.

788
01:14:50,533 --> 01:14:52,511
Oh my God, Sheriff!
They hit you!

789
01:14:52,673 --> 01:14:56,095
- Somebody help him!
- Do not worry, it's only glass.

790
01:14:59,387 --> 01:15:01,277
Where is the pro ladder roof?

791
01:15:01,378 --> 01:15:02,844
Ali

792
01:15:42,702 --> 01:15:45,085
are going after Sarah.
I have to help her!

793
01:15:45,086 --> 01:15:48,284
- Give me the radio! The radio!
- We have no radio!

794
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,308
Never had one!

795
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,232
- Cover me!
- Okay!

796
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:58,991
What will he do?

797
01:16:50,260 --> 01:16:51,720
Sarah!

798
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:04,772
That means I'm forgiven?

799
01:17:05,085 --> 01:17:07,214
Yeah, probably.

800
01:17:11,243 --> 01:17:13,458
Damn! I'm out of action!

801
01:17:20,257 --> 01:17:22,176
Damn! Always with me!

802
01:17:29,275 --> 01:17:30,775
Shit!

803
01:17:41,474 --> 01:17:43,188
Jesus!

804
01:17:50,855 --> 01:17:52,680
Motherfuckers!

805
01:18:01,835 --> 01:18:05,105
- Do not go here!
- Shut up, Grandma.

806
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:19,532
- Mrs. Salazar!
- Sheriff!

807
01:18:21,877 --> 01:18:23,336
Thanks.

808
01:18:24,577 --> 01:18:27,893
Ends soon with them, Ray!

809
01:18:28,015 --> 01:18:29,447
Right.

810
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:38,659
- Figue?
- Lewis! What are you doing?

811
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:40,260
Figue is right there!

812
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,360
Ray!

813
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:04,097
'Il get the Dinkum! I'll cover!

814
01:19:08,570 --> 01:19:09,925
Come. I'll help you.

815
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,009
I'll help you.

816
01:19:15,285 --> 01:19:16,948
Come.

817
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:31,189
You were doing out there?

818
01:19:31,268 --> 01:19:33,799
- I'm a cop.
- Be quiet.

819
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:55,012
Hey! I'm here!

820
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:01,869
You motherfucker!

821
01:20:03,010 --> 01:20:05,181
Come! Shoot!

822
01:20:09,366 --> 01:20:11,661
Where are you?

823
01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:16,317
His mice. Want to play?

824
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,533
I love playing.

825
01:20:20,862 --> 01:20:22,143
Okay.

826
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:25,622
Bag!

827
01:21:13,042 --> 01:21:14,663
Drop that gun.

828
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,431
Who are you, huh?

829
01:21:31,495 --> 01:21:33,735
I'm the sheriff.

830
01:21:56,425 --> 01:21:57,876
<i>'Ve got.</i>

831
01:21:58,708 --> 01:22:00,127
<i>You hear me?</i>

832
01:22:00,868 --> 01:22:02,364
<i>Ready me.</i>

833
01:22:02,855 --> 01:22:04,612
We'll.

834
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,520
You are very good at evasive, no?

835
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:57,958
You are very beautiful,
agent Richards.

836
01:23:04,110 --> 01:23:08,112
And nothing would please me more...

837
01:23:10,884 --> 01:23:13,078
that show you...

838
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:16,981
how good I am.

839
01:23:22,214 --> 01:23:26,192
But as you should still
playing the role of hostage

840
01:23:26,393 --> 01:23:29,841
consider it a parting gift.

841
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,138
What do you mean?

842
01:23:59,904 --> 01:24:01,701
What the fuck...

843
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:13,918
If you want to play, then
let's play!

844
01:24:36,509 --> 01:24:38,368
And now?

845
01:26:47,927 --> 01:26:49,715
You motherfucker!

846
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,239
I'll kill you!

847
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,790
Shit!

848
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,035
You've ruined my car.

849
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:29,443
And you just with my day off.

850
01:29:32,390 --> 01:29:34,110
You know, Sheriff?

851
01:29:34,284 --> 01:29:37,849
You just need to let me cross the border
.

852
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:43,988
12,000 Mexicans crossing
every single day.

853
01:29:44,190 --> 01:29:46,919
Should not care if a revisit.

854
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:49,224
What do you say?

855
01:29:49,225 --> 01:29:52,532
You're a disgrace to
immigrants.

856
01:29:56,444 --> 01:29:58,204
Okay.

857
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,669
So let's discuss
my deportation. Let?

858
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:06,467
Carlos, a moment.

859
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:11,074
This is my personal banker.
Just tell him the account number.

860
01:30:11,075 --> 01:30:13,649
You will
5 million dollars richer.

861
01:30:13,650 --> 01:30:15,918
And we'll leave as friends.

862
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,017
10 million.

863
01:30:34,610 --> 01:30:38,035
Place them, or I'll put them.

864
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,647
Maybe another time.

865
01:30:50,905 --> 01:30:53,445
His time has passed, Grandpa.

866
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:56,059
And mine is just beginning.

867
01:31:07,625 --> 01:31:09,591
Started playing.

868
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:11,297
Should have taken the money, Grandpa.

869
01:33:33,021 --> 01:33:35,744
Okay! Okay!

870
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:42,506
20 million!
20 million to do that overlook!

871
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:47,821
- My honour is not for sale.
- Fuck your honour!

872
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:22,854
You stuck.

873
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:49,951
Here comes the cavalry.

874
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,079
- John Bannister, FBI.
- Glad you came.

875
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,889
What happened here?
Where's Cortez?

876
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:02,489
The sheriff was after him.
I'm more worried about him

877
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:04,652
than with Cortez.

878
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:09,249
Is... You two are lucky.

879
01:35:27,010 --> 01:35:28,948
Check it out.

880
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:31,603
Excuse.

881
01:35:31,990 --> 01:35:33,503
Excuse.

882
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:41,389
The last time, this time the thing
turned against you.

883
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:43,314
Botem him there.

884
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:52,678
John!

885
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,605
Richards!

886
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,631
- Are you okay?
- I am. I'm cool.

887
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:01,637
I'm sorry, John.
He would kill me.

888
01:36:02,310 --> 01:36:04,517
It's so good to see you!

889
01:36:04,590 --> 01:36:08,613
Is. I'm glad you're alive.
Very happy.

890
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:15,200
Because now have the pleasure of
hold it personally.

891
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:20,955
Discovered that you were
partners in the drug business.

892
01:36:21,870 --> 01:36:26,390
And for your information, account in
Switzerland is no longer secret as it was.

893
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,077
Let.

894
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:37,255
Shit!

895
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:40,140
That's why I shot him!

896
01:36:41,690 --> 01:36:44,613
I can walk!
Just because I was wounded in combat

897
01:36:44,614 --> 01:36:46,989
not mean I cannot walk any more
.

898
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:49,689
Not true, Ray?
Martinez, Torrance?

899
01:36:49,690 --> 01:36:51,600
I can walk!

900
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:55,373
Christie But if you want to help me, I let
.

901
01:36:56,570 --> 01:36:59,270
- Thank you, darling.
- It was a pleasure, Lewis.

902
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,014
Figue!

903
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:05,771
Figue!

904
01:37:06,290 --> 01:37:09,582
Sorry! Sorry!
Let me see, let me see.

905
01:37:10,781 --> 01:37:14,795
- Was a 50 calibre!
- And very painful!

906
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:19,715
- Look at this. And you?
- I'm fine.

907
01:37:20,582 --> 01:37:23,355
Oh, come on.
Is a Balinha anything.

908
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:26,464
We do report and leave, right?

909
01:37:29,290 --> 01:37:30,983
Sorry.

910
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:34,378
I completely underestimated you
sheriff.

911
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:37,910
I'm fine.

912
01:37:47,805 --> 01:37:49,910
You are a tremendous police.

913
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:52,112
Not give up easily.

914
01:37:53,125 --> 01:37:56,996
'Re right. This is my home.

915
01:37:58,190 --> 01:37:59,876
Impressive.

916
01:38:01,790 --> 01:38:03,513
Impressive.

917
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:09,795
Sheriff...

918
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:18,391
Keep it.

919
01:38:21,288 --> 01:38:23,525
You deserved.

920
01:38:25,734 --> 01:38:27,034
Thanks, Ray

921
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:29,249
Jerry would like to stay with him.

922
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,919
Thanks.

923
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:40,364
Ray! Ray!

924
01:38:41,576 --> 01:38:45,224
For God's sake,
what happened to my car?

925
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:49,196
Next time, do not park in wave
Fire...

926
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:55,290
asshole.
