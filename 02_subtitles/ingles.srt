1
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:44,686
Look! It's Turbo Man and Booster!

2
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:46,923
Kill them both!

3
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:54,365
Turbo disk, anyone?

4
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,173
Stop him!

5
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,038
Go, go, Demon Team!

6
00:01:05,278 --> 00:01:06,336
Help, Turbo Man!

7
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:08,113
I'm coming, Billy!

8
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,282
Ta-ta, Turbo Man.

9
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:30,626
Five seconds to ignition.

10
00:01:52,058 --> 00:01:53,889
It's Turbo Time!

11
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:08,868
You haven't seen
the last of me, Turbo Man!

12
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,600
I'll have my revenge!

13
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,078
Here you go, Mr. President.

14
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,183
Thank you, Turbo Man.

15
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:30,919
You can always count on me.

16
00:02:32,365 --> 00:02:35,425
Go upstairs and change, hon.
It's almost time to leave.

17
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,967
But Dad's not home yet.

18
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:41,300
He'll probably miss me get my belt.

19
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:43,566
He misses everything.

20
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:45,039
He won't miss this.

21
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,371
He's probably just working hard.

22
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:14,467
Hello, Mr. Jacobs.

23
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,410
I'm going to make it.

24
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,181
200 by next Friday?

25
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,084
No problem. But only for you, because
you're our number one customer.

26
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,227
Andrea, hi.

27
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:39,757
If you think the fabric's too dark,
we'll just re-cover it...

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,934
...at no extra charge.

29
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:45,433
What do you expect?
You're my number one customer.

30
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,664
And don't you forget,
you're my number one customer.

31
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,536
You're my number one customer.

32
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,235
Honey, how are you?

33
00:03:53,446 --> 00:03:54,936
Howard, where are you?

34
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,842
I know, Jamie's karate class.

35
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:01,043
Don't worry, I'll meet you there.
I promise. Don't forget...

36
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:03,481
...you're my number one customer.

37
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:07,186
Look, I didn't mean that.

38
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,393
I'm gonna make it.
I'm gonna make it.

39
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,898
He's not gonna make it.

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,240
What the...?

41
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:48,330
The kids look great.

42
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,127
Yeah, they do.

43
00:04:50,604 --> 00:04:53,038
Ted, I baked you some cookies.

44
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:56,440
You know, to thank you for
fixing my screen door.

45
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,439
Thanks, Judy.

46
00:05:03,116 --> 00:05:07,712
Ted, I was wondering if you'd mind
taking a look at my porch light?

47
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:10,712
Just doesn't
seem to be working and...

48
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:13,358
...you being such a handyman...

49
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,357
Sure, I've got just the tool
for the job.

50
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:44,784
I'm gonna make it.

51
00:05:56,936 --> 00:05:58,301
Damn it!

52
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:01,496
Two!

53
00:06:02,108 --> 00:06:03,166
Three!

54
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,839
License and registration, please.

55
00:06:09,082 --> 00:06:10,515
I'm in kind of a hurry.

56
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:12,945
I'm late for my son's
karate class.

57
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:18,814
Oh, I do apologize if I've caused you
some sort of delay.

58
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,458
How thoughtless of me.

59
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,629
The last thing I want
on my conscience right now...

60
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,799
...is for a private citizen
to somehow be disappointed...

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,934
...in the performance of my duty.

62
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:33,165
Look, I was not criticizing you,
officer.

63
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,532
Step out of the car.

64
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,836
That's my boy!

65
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:47,853
There.

66
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:49,486
Are we finished now?

67
00:06:49,689 --> 00:06:51,520
Recite the alphabet.

68
00:06:54,394 --> 00:06:56,123
A, B, C...

69
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,459
Backwards.

70
00:07:09,275 --> 00:07:11,300
Way to go, Jamie!

71
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:45,611
I didn't make it.

72
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,005
Hey, neighbor!

73
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:16,833
Ted!

74
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:19,407
What are you doing on my roof?

75
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,671
What's Ted doing on your roof?

76
00:08:24,184 --> 00:08:26,243
I had some extra lights.

77
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:28,443
Since you didn't
put up any yourself...

78
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:33,422
...I thought, why not spread Christmas
cheer around the neighborhood?

79
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:34,819
Gee, Ted.

80
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:36,757
How thoughtful.

81
00:08:37,197 --> 00:08:39,665
Sorry you missed the karate class.

82
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:42,858
Don't worry, I got it all
on video for you.

83
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,696
What would I do without you?

84
00:08:50,777 --> 00:08:53,473
Did you tell Ted he could put
lights up on our house?

85
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,841
Do you know what time it is?

86
00:08:56,049 --> 00:08:59,849
I know. On top of the traffic
I got a speeding ticket.

87
00:09:00,053 --> 00:09:03,716
Don't explain it to me.
It wasn't my karate class you missed.

88
00:09:11,831 --> 00:09:12,855
Hi, buddy.

89
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:15,034
It's Turbo Time.

90
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:22,005
Now's your chance to save the
universe with Turbo Man.

91
00:09:22,308 --> 00:09:26,301
Battle evil with America's favorite
superhero and his sidekick, Booster.

92
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:27,706
Jamie...

93
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:30,144
...about that karate class tonight...

94
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,811
I was trying to...

95
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:36,746
Jamie, stop!

96
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,990
Listen.

97
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,089
It was not my fault.

98
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,154
Don't walk away from your father.

99
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,727
Can I come in?

100
00:09:56,676 --> 00:09:58,041
So, champ...

101
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,441
...are those hands registered weapons?

102
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:10,717
Is this it?

103
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:14,860
Wow! This is really cool.

104
00:10:15,395 --> 00:10:16,726
How do you do this?

105
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,696
Like this?

106
00:10:18,932 --> 00:10:20,092
No, I know.

107
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,032
Like this.

108
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,030
What do you think?

109
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,897
How about this?

110
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:48,955
I did something
really stupid today.

111
00:10:49,262 --> 00:10:50,388
I don't care.

112
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,325
Come on, Jamie.

113
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:56,068
I hope that's not true, because
I really wanted to be there.

114
00:10:56,402 --> 00:10:57,460
Believe me.

115
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:01,470
You always say that,
and you never come anyways.

116
00:11:01,741 --> 00:11:04,107
Purple was important to me, Dad.

117
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,768
That's one away from green
and three away from black.

118
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,448
I saw you get yellow.

119
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:11,206
But you missed blue.

120
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,754
You're right.

121
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:19,118
I really blew it.

122
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,585
I'm really, really sorry.

123
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:25,492
Can I make it up to you?

124
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,158
Like how?

125
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:31,063
Like letting me
do something special...

126
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,635
...just for you.

127
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,003
If there's something important you've
been wanting for Christmas...

128
00:11:37,543 --> 00:11:41,206
Don't worry, I got it covered.
I wrote Santa.

129
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:44,408
But Santa gets very busy
this time of year.

130
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:47,450
Sometimes he has to ask
moms and dads to help out.

131
00:11:48,154 --> 00:11:50,486
No, it's not that important.

132
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:52,151
Tell me.

133
00:11:53,026 --> 00:11:54,459
What do you want?

134
00:11:56,496 --> 00:11:59,988
I want the Turbo Man action figure
with arms and legs that move...

135
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:03,168
...and the boomerang and
the rocking rolling jetpack...

136
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:07,032
...and the voice activator
that says 5 different phrases...

137
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,038
...including "It's Turbo Time!"

138
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:13,007
Accessories sold separately.
Batteries not included.

139
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:16,675
I'm glad you had to think about it.

140
00:12:16,883 --> 00:12:19,943
Johnny's getting one
and so is everybody I know!

141
00:12:20,153 --> 00:12:22,644
Whoever doesn't
is gonna be a real loser.

142
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:25,119
That definitely won't be you.

143
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,655
Thanks, Dad.

144
00:12:26,893 --> 00:12:28,190
I love you.

145
00:12:28,394 --> 00:12:30,760
I love you too, Jamie.

146
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,595
You should have seen us.

147
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,098
We were bonding.

148
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:45,540
We were drawing, laughing,
talking about that Turbo guy.

149
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,239
Turbo Man.

150
00:12:47,447 --> 00:12:50,712
Which reminds me.
You got the doll, right?

151
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,579
The doll?

152
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:59,357
The Turbo Man doll. I asked you to
pick one up two weeks ago...?

153
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:06,458
That doll. Of course.

154
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,294
You didn't.

155
00:13:08,534 --> 00:13:11,196
Please tell me
you didn't forget that doll.

156
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:12,302
No, no, I...

157
00:13:12,572 --> 00:13:14,164
I got it.

158
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:17,467
The Turbo Man doll with
those things that shoot out...

159
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,769
...with the rock 'em,
sock 'em jetpack...

160
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:24,780
...and the realistic voice box that
says "It's Turbo Time." I got it.

161
00:13:25,418 --> 00:13:26,544
Good.

162
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:29,515
There you are.

163
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:33,555
You thought for a minute that I would
not do something you tell me.

164
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,852
I got it...

165
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:37,620
...right away.

166
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:40,221
Good.

167
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:44,199
Because at this point,
they'd probably be impossible to find.

168
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:51,075
KQRS Minneapolis. We'll do the
rockin' while you fill the stockin'.

169
00:13:54,147 --> 00:13:56,138
Wait! Hey, where you going?

170
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:59,910
I just have to run to the office
quickly. That's it.

171
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:04,283
Howard, it's Christmas Eve.
You can't be going to the office.

172
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,553
I have to pick up the D-O-L-L.

173
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:12,263
I left it there by mistake.

174
00:14:18,504 --> 00:14:21,234
You can't go.
What about the parade?

175
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,464
The parade?

176
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:25,302
The Holiday Wintertainment Parade.

177
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,939
You didn't go last year,
or the year before.

178
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:34,779
Mom and I always go. This year
Turbo Man's gonna be there!

179
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,386
Yeah, Turbo Man.

180
00:14:37,123 --> 00:14:38,147
"It's Turbo Time."

181
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:41,392
Dad, you can't miss it.
It'll be really cool.

182
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:43,322
I won't miss it.

183
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,187
I'll be there.

184
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:46,831
I promise.

185
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,537
Sorry about that, Howie.

186
00:15:00,213 --> 00:15:02,181
What's that, a reindeer?

187
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:03,848
A surprise for Johnny.

188
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:07,545
You just think of everything,
don't you?

189
00:15:07,753 --> 00:15:12,452
I believe you can never do too much
to make a child's Christmas magical.

190
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:15,249
What happens to Blitzen
after Christmas?

191
00:15:15,795 --> 00:15:18,889
I've been watching
a family of deer by the lake.

192
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:22,697
I thought I'd take him down there
and set him free.

193
00:15:22,902 --> 00:15:25,962
Maybe they'll take him in
like he's one of their own.

194
00:15:26,405 --> 00:15:28,066
How touching.

195
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,439
Hey, how are you?

196
00:15:34,046 --> 00:15:35,104
That's odd.

197
00:15:35,748 --> 00:15:38,012
Reindeer are usually gentle.

198
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,811
There's something about you
he doesn't like.

199
00:15:41,053 --> 00:15:43,385
Aftershave or something.

200
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,286
All right, got to go.

201
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:48,960
Where you off to?

202
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:51,789
Picking up a Christmas present
for Jamie.

203
00:15:52,331 --> 00:15:55,266
Nothing like waiting
till the last minute.

204
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,492
What'd you get?

205
00:15:56,769 --> 00:15:58,634
One of those Turbo Mans.

206
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,465
That's great.

207
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:03,233
I got a Turbo Man for Johnny
months ago.

208
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:06,206
It's nestled safely under our tree.

209
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,573
Good.

210
00:16:08,814 --> 00:16:11,908
By the way, they say
it may get icy later.

211
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:15,281
You might want to wrap
some chains around those tires.

212
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:17,683
Maybe I should wrap
some chains around you.

213
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,879
What?

214
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:22,020
Come on.

215
00:16:43,015 --> 00:16:44,346
What time do you open?

216
00:16:45,818 --> 00:16:47,183
It's freezing out here.

217
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,445
There's 100 people...

218
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,853
Because of two minutes? Because of
two minutes you're not letting...

219
00:16:55,861 --> 00:16:58,659
Give the man a break!
He's a dad, trying to get a toy!

220
00:16:58,864 --> 00:17:00,161
Go ahead and have cuts.

221
00:17:00,366 --> 00:17:01,958
Last-minute shopping?

222
00:17:02,168 --> 00:17:04,102
Enough to drive a man insane.

223
00:17:04,503 --> 00:17:05,834
Myron Larabee.

224
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:07,938
Howard Langston.

225
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,303
I'm late because it's the
busiest time of the year for me.

226
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,879
Christmas letters people send to
folks they talk to once a year.

227
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:19,345
And relatives sending gifts
they'll send back anyway.

228
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:22,851
How many toiletry kits
does a man need? Then what?

229
00:17:23,055 --> 00:17:25,114
Stupid letters from kids to Santa!

230
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,486
"Dear Santa, can you send me a bike
and a Slinky?"

231
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:30,161
No! Your father's laid off!

232
00:17:30,863 --> 00:17:34,128
As if I didn't have enough pressure,
my son sends me out...

233
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:37,496
...for some goofy toy, some fruity
robot named "Turtle Man."

234
00:17:37,703 --> 00:17:39,068
Turbo Man.

235
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,904
My son wants one too.

236
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,138
You know it's all a ploy.

237
00:17:45,678 --> 00:17:47,873
Man, don't you watch TV?!

238
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,981
We are being set up by
rich and powerful toy cartels!

239
00:17:51,384 --> 00:17:55,115
These fat cats use the working class,
like me and you!

240
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:58,118
They spend billions of dollars on
advertisements...

241
00:17:58,324 --> 00:18:02,055
...and use subliminal messages to
suck your children's minds out!

242
00:18:02,294 --> 00:18:04,558
I know, I went to junior college.

243
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,991
And I studied psychology!

244
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:08,564
I know what's going on!

245
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:12,259
They make a kid feel like garbage
if you, the father...

246
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,962
...who works 24/7 delivering mail...

247
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:19,372
...to make alimony payments to a woman
who had everyone at the office...

248
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,136
...but me!

249
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,248
Then the toy breaks and you can't
fix it because it's cheap plastic!

250
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,386
I'd like to walk up in that office,
grab one of those guys and...

251
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:31,749
...choke him until his eyes pop out!

252
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,550
Shouldn't wear fur.

253
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,890
Back off! I'm first!

254
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,564
Turbo Man, you're mine!

255
00:18:47,907 --> 00:18:49,204
Move it! Move it!

256
00:18:57,183 --> 00:18:58,844
Get out of my way!

257
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,385
Who wants Booster?

258
00:19:06,192 --> 00:19:08,922
The Turbo Man dolls,
they're all gone!

259
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:11,460
-There must be one.
-There are none!

260
00:19:11,697 --> 00:19:12,891
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

261
00:19:13,165 --> 00:19:15,065
-I need a Turbo Man.
-Me too.

262
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,996
Do you have any in back?

263
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:23,274
Why's he laughing?

264
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,968
Michael, these guys are looking
for a Turbo Man.

265
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:34,151
They're looking for Turbo Man.

266
00:19:36,455 --> 00:19:39,947
Hey, everybody, these two
are looking for a Turbo Man.

267
00:19:41,026 --> 00:19:42,084
Shut up!

268
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:44,691
Yeah, what's so funny?

269
00:19:44,997 --> 00:19:49,491
Where have you guys been? Turbo Man's
only the hottest selling toy ever.

270
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,266
But we got plenty of Turbo Man's
saber-toothed tiger, Booster.

271
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:03,107
Where's your Christmas spirit?

272
00:20:06,886 --> 00:20:08,786
That's better.

273
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:12,918
There must be a Turbo Man
here somewhere.

274
00:20:15,361 --> 00:20:18,558
The last one just left.
A lady had it on layaway.

275
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,129
A lady? What lady?

276
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,765
Short...

277
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,662
...with a fur coat!

278
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:24,961
Sorry, buddy!

279
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:34,812
Give me this.

280
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,571
This is war.

281
00:20:48,561 --> 00:20:51,052
Oh, poor baby!

282
00:21:03,943 --> 00:21:04,967
Hey, lady!

283
00:21:05,578 --> 00:21:07,102
Hey, hold it!

284
00:21:07,446 --> 00:21:08,640
Wait!

285
00:21:09,448 --> 00:21:10,745
Wait, lady!

286
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,043
I need that Turbo Man!

287
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:15,276
Wait!

288
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:44,142
I'm Turbo Man.

289
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:46,606
No, I am!
You're always Turbo Man.

290
00:22:46,812 --> 00:22:48,677
-You be Dementor.
-Heck, no.

291
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,041
Cut it out.

292
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,908
-Hi, Liz.
-Oh, hi, Ted.

293
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:57,652
It's Christmas Eve and you're
slaving over a hot stove.

294
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,255
"Mom of the Year."

295
00:22:59,491 --> 00:23:00,822
It's no big deal.

296
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,187
And modest too.

297
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:09,356
Looks like you could use
some "you time."

298
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:14,267
Go upstairs, take a bath. I'll watch
the boys, finish up with the cookies.

299
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:17,068
Go on.

300
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:19,005
You deserve it.

301
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,206
Well, okay, but, you know...

302
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:28,413
I know, sugar cookies.
Bake 1 2 to 1 5 minutes...

303
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:32,088
...till golden brown.
Ted's got everything under control!

304
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:39,258
Pipe down in there!

305
00:23:42,935 --> 00:23:45,369
Merry Christmas!
Langston residence.

306
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:50,568
Howard! How's it going out there?
Everything okay?

307
00:23:50,776 --> 00:23:53,108
Fine. I need to speak to Liz.

308
00:23:53,345 --> 00:23:54,505
Could you get...?

309
00:23:55,748 --> 00:23:59,616
Excuse me, but your wife's cookies
are out of this world.

310
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:03,012
What? Who told you
you can eat my cookies?

311
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:06,314
I'm just helping Liz out a little
in the kitchen.

312
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:11,790
I need to speak to my wife, so could
you get her on the phone, please?

313
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,964
She may be showering, should I check?

314
00:24:14,199 --> 00:24:15,097
No!

315
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,902
I mean, no. It's fine.

316
00:24:18,103 --> 00:24:21,266
On your way out, tell her
I will be a few minutes late.

317
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:22,770
But she shouldn't worry.

318
00:24:22,975 --> 00:24:25,205
She won't. I mean, I'm here and...

319
00:24:26,111 --> 00:24:29,603
Oh, these cookies! I gotta get
the recipe from Liz.

320
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:31,110
Put that cookie down!

321
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,681
Now!

322
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:36,352
Is something bothering you?

323
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:39,615
At Christmas there's
a high incidence of breakdowns.

324
00:24:40,425 --> 00:24:43,792
There's the next batch.
I'll give Liz your message.

325
00:24:51,804 --> 00:24:53,635
Hey, look who it is!

326
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,529
Still on the hunt?

327
00:24:55,941 --> 00:24:57,533
Sorry about whacking you.

328
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,870
Got caught up in the friendly
spirit of competition.

329
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:02,135
That's all right.

330
00:25:02,381 --> 00:25:05,282
I was thinking you'd have
done the same thing.

331
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:08,577
Then I realized we're the same
kind of person.

332
00:25:08,821 --> 00:25:10,152
I doubt that.

333
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:14,052
Outside of the brouhaha in the store,
we could form a team.

334
00:25:14,259 --> 00:25:16,693
You know, like Starsky and Hutch.

335
00:25:16,895 --> 00:25:18,692
Like lke and Tina.

336
00:25:18,897 --> 00:25:20,922
Maybe we could do it!

337
00:25:21,133 --> 00:25:24,625
Search and destroy. Divide
and conquer! What do you say?

338
00:25:24,903 --> 00:25:26,302
Thanks, Myron...

339
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:27,733
...but no, thank you.

340
00:25:27,973 --> 00:25:30,305
Let's do it, man!
Let's be a team!

341
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:33,807
Gee, Myron, I think
you're a good guy and all...

342
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,640
...but this I would like
to do by myself.

343
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:38,613
You understand...

344
00:25:38,817 --> 00:25:39,909
...right?

345
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:44,155
I understand you!

346
00:25:44,356 --> 00:25:45,789
I know what's going on.

347
00:25:45,991 --> 00:25:49,757
Mister, with your fancy cashmere coat
and little suede shoes.

348
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:53,123
I was good enough to talk to in line,
but not to be on your team!

349
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:56,597
That's racism! That's what
Jesse Jackson talks about.

350
00:25:56,802 --> 00:25:59,464
They got a delivery of
Turbo Man at Toy Works!

351
00:25:59,671 --> 00:26:01,434
-Turbo Man!
-Turbo Man!

352
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,107
Piece of junk!

353
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:38,376
Officer...

354
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:40,306
You broke my little mirror.

355
00:26:42,547 --> 00:26:45,345
License and registration, please.

356
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,510
Is there a problem, officer?

357
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:17,080
Listen up, people!

358
00:27:17,349 --> 00:27:19,840
As to your first question: Yes!

359
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,382
The rumors are true.

360
00:27:21,586 --> 00:27:25,579
We have received a small quantity
of the Turbo Man action figure.

361
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:30,592
I'm not going to ask you people
to be quiet again!

362
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:32,320
Here's how this will work.

363
00:27:32,531 --> 00:27:37,264
Form an orderly line so an employee
can hand you a numbered ball.

364
00:27:37,469 --> 00:27:38,401
These balls...

365
00:27:38,603 --> 00:27:42,801
...will then be drawn in lottery
fashion to see who gets a doll.

366
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:44,941
If you're not one of them...

367
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:50,009
...we have plenty of Turbo Man's
pet tiger, Booster, in stock.

368
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:52,445
We don't want it! We don't want it!

369
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:53,777
Who wants Booster?

370
00:27:54,052 --> 00:27:56,748
In accordance with the laws
of supply and demand...

371
00:27:56,955 --> 00:27:59,082
...the price of each
figure has doubled.

372
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,860
I got it! I got it!

373
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:49,966
-He maced me!
-I got it!

374
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:53,343
I got it! I got it!

375
00:28:54,513 --> 00:28:57,175
He got two! He got two!

376
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:58,939
Get the mailman!

377
00:28:59,751 --> 00:29:00,775
Get him!

378
00:29:01,086 --> 00:29:02,553
He's lying!

379
00:29:10,595 --> 00:29:11,687
That's my ball!

380
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:14,092
Rodney King! Rodney King!

381
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:56,030
This is my ball. Stay.

382
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:53,957
Hi, little girl.

383
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,763
Look what I've got.

384
00:30:57,002 --> 00:30:59,630
A shiny red ball.

385
00:30:59,838 --> 00:31:01,305
Want to trade?

386
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:05,542
Give me the ball!

387
00:31:07,012 --> 00:31:08,707
Sicko! Pervert!

388
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:10,709
Get your hands off my kid!

389
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:11,780
I need the ball!

390
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,882
I need that toy!

391
00:31:21,993 --> 00:31:23,585
I need that toy.

392
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,162
-Pervert!
-I'm not a pervert!

393
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:30,027
I just was looking for
Turbo Man doll!

394
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:34,430
Hey, come here.

395
00:31:34,673 --> 00:31:35,503
Come here.

396
00:31:37,008 --> 00:31:38,669
You want a Turbo Man?

397
00:31:39,344 --> 00:31:42,040
Forget it. I'm not
gonna sit on your lap.

398
00:31:42,681 --> 00:31:45,275
That's not my bag. Get it?

399
00:31:45,717 --> 00:31:48,208
You know, little boy,
with your attitude...

400
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:50,648
...I don't think I'll
give you access to this.

401
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:51,981
Tony, show him.

402
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:56,289
That was taken this morning.

403
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:04,194
How do I know this isn't a scam?

404
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:05,801
Forget it, Tony.

405
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,562
He doesn't want our help.

406
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,534
Wait a minute, guys.

407
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:13,268
We're businessmen. I'm sure
we can work out an agreement.

408
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:16,047
You got cash, we got the doll.

409
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:17,442
How much?

410
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:21,847
Merry Christmas!

411
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:25,183
A Merry Christmas to you.

412
00:32:25,824 --> 00:32:26,813
Are you crazy?

413
00:32:27,025 --> 00:32:29,050
Santa doesn't deliver
in broad daylight.

414
00:32:29,394 --> 00:32:31,726
Excuse me. I may be wrong...

415
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,160
...but you're not the real Santa.

416
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,927
Really? And you're not the kind
of guy who's got enough foresight...

417
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,037
...to get his kid a Turbo Man
before Christmas Eve.

418
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:45,535
Show a little respect
for the suit, huh?

419
00:32:48,413 --> 00:32:49,744
Do you want the doll?

420
00:32:54,052 --> 00:32:56,612
Come on, I got a parade to go to...

421
00:32:56,855 --> 00:32:59,449
...and I haven't yet seen
this Turbo Man doll.

422
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:01,021
Hang a left.

423
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:05,185
He's a little boy
Who Santa Claus forgot

424
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:07,693
Beautiful.

425
00:33:10,568 --> 00:33:11,557
Up here.

426
00:33:13,138 --> 00:33:16,335
I love this time of year.
Christmas carols...

427
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:18,873
...snowflakes, Santa Clauses.

428
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:20,101
Now what?

429
00:33:20,378 --> 00:33:23,643
Are you Dan Rather?
What are you, the question king?

430
00:33:23,948 --> 00:33:25,210
Chill.

431
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:39,824
All right, keep your hands
where I can see them.

432
00:33:49,474 --> 00:33:50,805
Password.

433
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:54,476
Jingle bells, Batman smells.

434
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,461
I know what you're thinking.

435
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,169
Oh, no.

436
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:24,339
You have no idea.

437
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,102
Tony, get the man his Turbo Man.

438
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:28,774
Got it.

439
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,674
I gotta tell you, Santa...

440
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:33,942
...there's something here
that doesn't seem quite...

441
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:35,176
...kosher.

442
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:37,780
Kosher?

443
00:34:38,356 --> 00:34:42,019
This, coming from a guy who assaulted
a toddler for a superball?

444
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,788
Listen, we provide a service here.

445
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:46,360
We don't do this for us.

446
00:34:46,631 --> 00:34:48,155
We do it for the kids.

447
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,697
For the kids?

448
00:34:49,901 --> 00:34:53,393
For every kid who ever
sat down on Santa's lap.

449
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:58,041
Every little girl who left cookies
and milk for Santa on Christmas night.

450
00:34:58,243 --> 00:35:02,339
Every boy who opens a gift Christmas
morning and finds clothes...

451
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,571
...instead of toys.

452
00:35:06,251 --> 00:35:08,219
It breaks my heart.

453
00:35:09,721 --> 00:35:10,710
There it is.

454
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:12,721
That'll be 300.

455
00:35:13,825 --> 00:35:14,655
Dollars?

456
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,487
No, chocolate kisses!
Yes, dollars!

457
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,229
I can't believe this.

458
00:35:19,431 --> 00:35:23,367
What happened to your lofty ideals?
I thought you did this for the kids.

459
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:24,432
Well, sure.

460
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:27,365
I don't see why we can't make
some money in the process.

461
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:29,036
Take it.

462
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,070
Count it.

463
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:31,765
Put it in the safe.

464
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,170
Don't open that up!

465
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:41,777
Well, that's
the multilingual version.

466
00:35:42,353 --> 00:35:44,082
It's fun and educational.

467
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,417
I wouldn't...

468
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:51,187
Of course,
there's some assembly required.

469
00:35:51,396 --> 00:35:52,294
Let me get that.

470
00:35:52,931 --> 00:35:54,262
Put it in the box and...

471
00:35:54,532 --> 00:35:56,932
Forget it. Give me the money back.

472
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,132
All sales are final.

473
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,566
You know what you are?

474
00:36:02,807 --> 00:36:05,935
Nothing but a bunch of sleazy
con men in red suits.

475
00:36:07,545 --> 00:36:08,603
What?

476
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:09,905
You heard me.

477
00:36:10,114 --> 00:36:14,107
Con men, thieves, degenerates,
low-lifes, thugs, criminals!

478
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:18,916
In the North Pole,
them are fighting words, partner.

479
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:20,090
Put 'em up!

480
00:36:20,291 --> 00:36:21,588
Relax, buddy.

481
00:36:21,826 --> 00:36:23,919
I'm not about to hit a Santa Claus.

482
00:36:24,128 --> 00:36:25,322
Are you chicken?

483
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,740
Get him!

484
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:54,989
Shut up!

485
00:37:14,879 --> 00:37:17,370
I'm gonna deck your halls, bub.

486
00:37:44,976 --> 00:37:46,341
Little buddy!

487
00:37:47,745 --> 00:37:49,679
You're a naughty boy!

488
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,310
Who's gonna be next?

489
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:01,047
Dog pile!

490
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,862
It's the Grinch!
Scatter!

491
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:29,718
Who are you?

492
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:35,656
Hey, buddy!

493
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:40,056
This is the sloppiest bust
I've ever seen in my entire career.

494
00:38:40,765 --> 00:38:42,630
Detective Lang, undercover.

495
00:38:43,334 --> 00:38:46,462
I've been working on this case
for the last 3 years...

496
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:51,402
...and you come barging in here like a
bunch of terrorists at a tea party!

497
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,903
Wait till the commissioner finds out.

498
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:56,146
He's going to hit the roof!

499
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,941
Now get your act together
and arrest someone!

500
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:00,207
Go!

501
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:06,721
I'm not going back to the joint!

502
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:09,391
Put them in the van and lock them up!

503
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:22,169
Come on.

504
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,635
Come on, not now!

505
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:58,472
You're so considerate,
bringing all this holiday cheer.

506
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,439
Christmas comes but once a year.

507
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:03,036
You're an amazing man, Ted.

508
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:05,715
I wish every husband
was more like you.

509
00:40:06,017 --> 00:40:09,111
Thanks. We should get together
and swap recipes.

510
00:40:09,353 --> 00:40:11,150
What's the reindeer's name?

511
00:40:11,389 --> 00:40:13,380
I named him Ted, after my dad.

512
00:40:15,093 --> 00:40:18,995
Your dad is so cool. I wish
my dad did stuff like this.

513
00:40:19,197 --> 00:40:22,223
He never used to. Not until
he and my mom split up.

514
00:40:22,867 --> 00:40:23,834
Really?

515
00:40:24,202 --> 00:40:28,866
Maybe your parents should get
a divorce. Did wonders for my dad.

516
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,708
Hot chocolate?

517
00:40:48,526 --> 00:40:50,289
How you doing, buddy?

518
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:53,357
Hi, Dad. I knew you'd call.

519
00:40:53,765 --> 00:40:55,062
Let me talk to your mom.

520
00:40:55,266 --> 00:40:57,029
-You can't.
-Why not?

521
00:40:57,368 --> 00:40:59,268
She's next door petting Ted.

522
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,698
She's what?

523
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:04,636
Are you on your way?
The parade's gonna start soon.

524
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:06,134
Get your mother.

525
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,242
-Are you?
-Am I what?

526
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:09,674
Coming home soon?

527
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,975
Yes, immediately.
Now please get your mother.

528
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:17,483
Before you left, you promised
that you'd be at the parade.

529
00:41:17,722 --> 00:41:21,317
You haven't been here all day,
so you can't miss it.

530
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:23,583
Jamie, please...

531
00:41:23,895 --> 00:41:27,888
'Cause when someone makes a promise,
they should keep it.

532
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:30,467
It's like what Turbo Man says:

533
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:33,637
"Always keep your promises if you want
to keep your friends."

534
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:34,668
Enough!

535
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:36,430
Enough of this Turbo Man, okay?

536
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:38,506
I've had it up to here.

537
00:41:38,743 --> 00:41:41,803
If there's anyone I don't
want advice from, it's Turbo Man!

538
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,844
Now, get your mother.

539
00:41:49,287 --> 00:41:50,845
I'm sorry, Jamie.

540
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:52,077
Look...

541
00:41:53,925 --> 00:41:58,294
What would you know about
keeping your promises? You never do!

542
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:01,464
You never do anything you
say you're going to do!

543
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:02,858
Ever!

544
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:06,965
Damn you, Howard.

545
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,617
Here you go, my man.
This'll warm you up.

546
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:35,195
Cheers.

547
00:42:37,068 --> 00:42:37,898
You!

548
00:42:38,336 --> 00:42:39,428
Peace.

549
00:42:39,704 --> 00:42:41,604
'Tis the season to be jolly.

550
00:42:42,673 --> 00:42:43,765
Right.

551
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:47,838
Any luck finding the doll?

552
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:49,439
No.

553
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,974
Me neither.

554
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:53,048
Maybe this will help.

555
00:42:56,387 --> 00:42:57,513
What the hell?

556
00:43:02,026 --> 00:43:04,358
So I couldn't find the kid a doll.

557
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:06,689
Does that make me a bad father?

558
00:43:06,964 --> 00:43:08,124
No.

559
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,733
But yelling at him
for no reason...

560
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:12,970
...that makes me a bad father.

561
00:43:13,304 --> 00:43:16,967
We get one chance a year to prove
we're not screwups and what happens?

562
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:18,641
We screw it up.

563
00:43:19,043 --> 00:43:21,170
I remember a few years ago...

564
00:43:21,379 --> 00:43:23,904
...I wanted to do something
special for Jamie.

565
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:25,540
So...

566
00:43:26,317 --> 00:43:28,877
...I built him his own clubhouse.

567
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,320
It came out great.

568
00:43:31,555 --> 00:43:34,752
Well, I mean, the door
was a little crooked, right?

569
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:38,894
And the roof wasn't straight,
but you should've seen his face.

570
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,860
When he saw that, he was so excited.

571
00:43:42,733 --> 00:43:45,201
We played in the clubhouse all day.

572
00:43:45,403 --> 00:43:47,394
He even made us have dinner in it.

573
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,005
I was the hero then.

574
00:43:54,578 --> 00:43:55,943
Look at me now.

575
00:43:56,213 --> 00:43:58,477
He's gonna need serious therapy, man.

576
00:43:58,683 --> 00:43:59,672
Don't say that.

577
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,149
I know what I'm talking about.

578
00:44:03,387 --> 00:44:05,719
See, I never forgave my father.

579
00:44:05,957 --> 00:44:08,357
One Christmas I wanted a special toy:

580
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:10,117
Johnny-7 OMA gun.

581
00:44:10,328 --> 00:44:11,795
You remember those?

582
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,988
I remember the commercial.

583
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:18,691
Two kids playing in the back yard.
"Johnny to Peter, enemy sighted."

584
00:44:18,903 --> 00:44:20,928
"Roger there. Open fire."

585
00:44:21,172 --> 00:44:25,836
Then Johnny whips out his
Johnny-7 OMA gun. Seven guns in one.

586
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:30,578
Thing looked like a blast.

587
00:44:33,017 --> 00:44:35,611
But, of course, with my old man...

588
00:44:35,853 --> 00:44:39,721
...Christmas was just another
opportunity to let me down.

589
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:42,522
I never got the Johnny-7 OMA.

590
00:44:44,462 --> 00:44:45,690
Sorry to hear that.

591
00:44:45,896 --> 00:44:47,591
Don't mean nothing.

592
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,091
Ever heard of Scott Sherman?

593
00:44:51,302 --> 00:44:53,896
Yeah, CEO of Sherman Industries.

594
00:44:54,205 --> 00:44:55,695
He was my old neighbor...

595
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,602
...and his dad
got him a Johnny-7 OMA gun.

596
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,407
You know what happened?

597
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:02,340
He became a billionaire.

598
00:45:02,546 --> 00:45:03,672
And me...

599
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:05,075
...well...

600
00:45:05,616 --> 00:45:06,742
...l'm just a loser...

601
00:45:06,951 --> 00:45:08,441
...with no future.

602
00:45:09,754 --> 00:45:12,052
Here's to you, Dad.

603
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:25,230
I can't let this happen.

604
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:27,632
It's just a doll.

605
00:45:27,972 --> 00:45:30,133
It's just a stupid
little plastic doll.

606
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,133
Action figure.

607
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:34,344
There's gotta be one somewhere!

608
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:38,103
You say you've been looking
everywhere for a Turbo Man doll?

609
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:42,316
You say you'd do just about
anything to get one?

610
00:45:43,254 --> 00:45:45,154
KQRS has good news for you.

611
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:49,224
If you're the first caller to
identify Santa's reindeer...

612
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:52,555
...you'll get the hottest toy since
Johnny-7 OMA.

613
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:56,722
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,
Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

614
00:45:59,003 --> 00:46:00,903
I don't think so, buddy.

615
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,277
Come on.

616
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,242
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone!

617
00:46:17,088 --> 00:46:18,749
Come on, answer it.

618
00:46:18,956 --> 00:46:19,923
KQRS, hello.

619
00:46:20,124 --> 00:46:22,422
-I got the answer!
-No, you don't!

620
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:31,931
-Why did you do that?!
-9-1 -1! 9-1 -1!

621
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:32,999
I got through!

622
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,704
You guys, the radio station's just
2 blocks down, on Wabasha.

623
00:46:44,882 --> 00:46:46,110
I got...

624
00:46:46,884 --> 00:46:47,816
...the answer.

625
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:49,542
I got the answer.

626
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:52,882
Bye-bye! Sorry!

627
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,422
You barked up the wrong tree.

628
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,330
I can run like this for miles.

629
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:07,231
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet,
Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

630
00:47:14,812 --> 00:47:16,905
I'm having a good time! Bye!

631
00:47:29,193 --> 00:47:30,956
KQRS, you're on the air.

632
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:33,422
Randy, Jermaine, Tito...

633
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,099
No, not even close. Sorry.

634
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,495
Maybe this'll put us in the mood.

635
00:47:38,802 --> 00:47:40,736
Let me in! I got the answer!

636
00:47:40,938 --> 00:47:41,802
Open up!

637
00:47:42,006 --> 00:47:45,635
I got the answer! I got the answer!
Open up!

638
00:47:47,344 --> 00:47:49,369
I got a madman in my studio.

639
00:47:51,315 --> 00:47:52,339
Help me!

640
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,710
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen!

641
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,255
I couldn't get you on the phone.
Did I win?

642
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:01,356
I won! I won!

643
00:48:01,592 --> 00:48:03,025
No! Wait, wait, wait!

644
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:06,822
Too late. I already got
the right answer. I won.

645
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,828
I don't need the answer to win!
I got this!

646
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:12,161
What's that?

647
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:16,271
This, Mr. Track Star,
is a homemade explosive device!

648
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:19,199
A bomb?

649
00:48:19,643 --> 00:48:20,769
Yes, in layman's terms...

650
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,843
...a bomb! So back up!

651
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:24,480
You built a bomb?

652
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:27,116
I didn't have to.
Don't you read the news?

653
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:31,186
These things come through
the mail every day! I kept one.

654
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:34,846
So give me the doll,
or I'll blow everyone up!

655
00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:37,527
Are you crazy? Put this thing away!

656
00:48:37,728 --> 00:48:38,626
It's not worth it!

657
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:40,990
To me it is! So back up!

658
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:42,199
Back up!

659
00:48:43,334 --> 00:48:44,392
Come on, buddy.

660
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,863
Give me the package.

661
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:48,470
-Let's have it.
-Did you call me buddy?

662
00:48:48,806 --> 00:48:49,966
I'm not your buddy!

663
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:55,043
I tried to be your teammate! Your
friend! But no, you had other plans.

664
00:48:55,279 --> 00:48:56,337
I had no plans.

665
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,411
You are no different than the rest!

666
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:02,641
Those letter-writers who make fun
of my knee socks in the summer!

667
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:06,256
Are you laughing at me?

668
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:08,922
No, Lord, no. Not at all.

669
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:11,856
Mr. Ponytail Man, I know you!
I know your kind!

670
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:16,863
You put a trash can in front of the
mailbox so I gotta get out of my jeep.

671
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:18,261
No! I recycle.

672
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:20,198
-Shut up!
-Yeah, shut up!

673
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:23,032
Why's the window there?
So I can just put the mail in!

674
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,368
But you act like everything's okay!
Hey, Mr. Mailman!

675
00:49:26,577 --> 00:49:29,068
Like I have no feelings of my own!

676
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:30,541
Hit the deck!

677
00:49:48,932 --> 00:49:50,092
I'm sorry.

678
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:52,166
I've been under pressure.

679
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:55,330
Don't hit me! I got sickle cell!

680
00:49:56,273 --> 00:50:01,108
Are you under the impression I have a
Turbo Man doll here in the studio?

681
00:50:01,345 --> 00:50:03,540
-Yes.
-That's what you said on the radio.

682
00:50:03,747 --> 00:50:04,907
-Yes, you did.
-No, no!

683
00:50:05,649 --> 00:50:09,517
What I actually said was whoever won
would get a doll...

684
00:50:09,753 --> 00:50:11,015
...eventually.

685
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:16,455
You see, what we have here...

686
00:50:17,161 --> 00:50:18,651
...is a gift certificate.

687
00:50:18,862 --> 00:50:19,988
A gift certificate?!

688
00:50:20,197 --> 00:50:21,027
Right.

689
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:25,361
A certificate for a doll when
they get some in the stores.

690
00:50:29,973 --> 00:50:32,373
-Did you call the cops?
-Kind of.

691
00:50:32,576 --> 00:50:35,067
Let's get out of here.
But I'm first!

692
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:43,310
Better luck next time, loser!

693
00:50:43,687 --> 00:50:44,847
Freeze!

694
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:52,856
Just can't stay
out of trouble, can you?

695
00:50:53,063 --> 00:50:55,327
Don't hurt a fellow civil servant.

696
00:50:55,566 --> 00:50:56,533
All this violence!

697
00:50:56,767 --> 00:50:59,930
It's Christmas, and I was
just delivering some...

698
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,764
Back up! This is a
homemade explosive device.

699
00:51:02,973 --> 00:51:03,803
I'll blow it up!

700
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:07,442
I work for the post office,
so you know I'm not stable!

701
00:51:07,778 --> 00:51:08,710
Tell them!

702
00:51:11,048 --> 00:51:12,845
This man is totally insane.

703
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:16,713
Thank you! Now put the guns down.
Now!

704
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,945
Brother, put your gun down!

705
00:51:19,189 --> 00:51:20,281
Everybody!

706
00:51:20,891 --> 00:51:22,620
You too, Barnaby Jones.

707
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:33,734
Just stay there.

708
00:51:34,471 --> 00:51:37,907
I'll know if you move, because I have
the ear of a snake!

709
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:39,473
Ciao, baby.

710
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,981
You shouldn't touch that.

711
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,912
Relax, Sparky...

712
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:54,750
...I was on the bomb squad
for 10 years.

713
00:52:09,573 --> 00:52:11,404
I'm the man! I'm the man!

714
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:12,540
Gentlemen...

715
00:52:13,277 --> 00:52:14,938
...we've been duped.

716
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,377
This is nothing but a
harmless Christmas package.

717
00:52:24,888 --> 00:52:26,355
That was really a bomb?

718
00:52:26,557 --> 00:52:29,048
This is a sick world
we're living in!

719
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:33,963
How many years in the bomb squad?

720
00:53:11,568 --> 00:53:13,035
Thanks a lot.

721
00:53:25,716 --> 00:53:27,946
That son of a...

722
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,482
What are you doing?

723
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:38,257
Your star wasn't up.
It's Christmas Eve, it has to be up.

724
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:40,424
I'm out all day...

725
00:53:41,231 --> 00:53:43,392
...and he's in my house...

726
00:53:43,834 --> 00:53:45,802
...putting up my star...

727
00:53:46,003 --> 00:53:47,630
...on my tree.

728
00:53:49,806 --> 00:53:52,206
I got a Turbo Man for Johnny
months ago.

729
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:55,003
It's nestled safely under our tree.

730
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:58,739
Nestled safely under our tree.
Safely under our tree...

731
00:54:00,484 --> 00:54:02,349
I'll show him.

732
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,820
I'm sorry, Ted,
but that's Howard's job.

733
00:54:10,027 --> 00:54:12,723
He puts the star on.
He's adamant about it.

734
00:54:13,063 --> 00:54:15,861
Too bad he's not adamant about
being with his family...

735
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:17,431
...on Christmas Eve.

736
00:54:45,228 --> 00:54:47,287
It's Turbo Time!

737
00:54:53,604 --> 00:54:56,095
Liz, do you hear that?

738
00:54:56,373 --> 00:54:57,670
Carolers.

739
00:54:57,874 --> 00:55:00,001
Let's go. Come on!

740
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:02,507
We wish you a Merry Christmas
We wish you a Merry Christmas

741
00:55:02,713 --> 00:55:06,706
We wish you a Merry Christmas
And a Happy New Year

742
00:55:07,017 --> 00:55:08,450
The back door.

743
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:14,790
Good tidings for Christmas
And a Happy New Year

744
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:19,788
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding

745
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:21,725
Now bring us some figgy pudding

746
00:55:32,709 --> 00:55:35,872
What am I doing?

747
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,273
Look at me.

748
00:55:38,281 --> 00:55:40,374
Stealing from a kid.

749
00:55:42,886 --> 00:55:44,615
I can't do this.

750
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:48,147
You're gonna go back.

751
00:55:51,895 --> 00:55:52,884
Nice doggy.

752
00:55:54,564 --> 00:55:56,122
Nice...

753
00:56:33,136 --> 00:56:37,232
Now bring us some figgy pudding
Now bring us some figgy pudding

754
00:56:58,328 --> 00:56:59,920
Balthazar!

755
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:03,129
Howard?

756
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:12,700
What are you doing?

757
00:57:14,711 --> 00:57:15,769
What's that?

758
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:19,114
You can always count on me!

759
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:21,147
That is Johnny's Turbo Man.

760
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:22,416
What?

761
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:24,246
It's not what you think.

762
00:57:24,488 --> 00:57:25,921
It isn't? Really?

763
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:30,025
Then tell me. You said you got
Jamie a Turbo Man weeks ago.

764
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,663
It looks like you broke into
Ted's house and stole presents!

765
00:57:34,865 --> 00:57:37,663
If you give me a second,
I could explain it.

766
00:57:38,135 --> 00:57:41,662
I know parts of this are going
to sound completely ridiculous...

767
00:57:41,972 --> 00:57:43,872
...but let me tell you the truth.

768
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:48,635
I've been listening to your version
of the truth for far too long.

769
00:57:48,845 --> 00:57:52,645
All I want is to salvage what's
left of Christmas Eve...

770
00:57:52,849 --> 00:57:55,374
...and go to the parade with my son.

771
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:57,780
Liz, please...

772
00:58:00,056 --> 00:58:02,047
-Would you drive us?
-Of course.

773
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:10,557
You can't bench-press
your way out of this one.

774
00:58:13,136 --> 00:58:14,865
Oh, God.

775
00:58:21,011 --> 00:58:22,706
You picked the wrong day.

776
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,688
You started it.

777
00:58:38,428 --> 00:58:41,420
Mom, do you think Dad's
going to be at the parade?

778
00:58:41,631 --> 00:58:43,565
I wouldn't count on it.

779
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:50,370
Turbo Man's gonna be there.
You can always count on him.

780
00:58:53,376 --> 00:58:55,571
Hey, Rudolph, can I
buy you another round?

781
00:59:27,577 --> 00:59:29,067
Sorry, buddy...

782
00:59:29,279 --> 00:59:31,110
...but you're on your own.

783
00:59:33,116 --> 00:59:36,142
It's time I start
keeping my promises.

784
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:10,077
It's that time of year again.

785
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:12,983
The 1 2th Annual
Holiday Wintertainment Parade.

786
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:17,352
I'm Gale Force, here with the lovely
Liza Tisch of "AM Live."

787
01:00:17,594 --> 01:00:19,425
Merry Christmas, Gale.

788
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:22,154
We're high atop Channel 29's
Parade Central...

789
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:25,425
...to keep you updated on all
of this year's parade action.

790
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:26,991
Let's watch...

791
01:00:27,203 --> 01:00:29,034
And listen.

792
01:00:51,962 --> 01:00:53,953
The parade's already started!

793
01:00:54,698 --> 01:00:56,495
There's Owen and his dad.

794
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,692
Can we stand with them
while you park the car?

795
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:00,801
Please?

796
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:06,598
We'll meet you there.

797
01:01:06,810 --> 01:01:08,869
And don't go wandering off.

798
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:11,479
Jamie, put on your hat.

799
01:01:11,681 --> 01:01:13,171
I know.

800
01:01:27,664 --> 01:01:28,858
Check it out!

801
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:30,692
You see Turbo Man?

802
01:01:31,034 --> 01:01:33,195
No, they're saving him for last.

803
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,546
This is awesome!

804
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:52,221
Cat in the Hat!

805
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,283
Can't you take 4th Street?

806
01:01:58,528 --> 01:02:01,793
Sorry, the roads are packed.
Everyone's going to the parade.

807
01:02:02,065 --> 01:02:03,555
Turbo Man's gonna be there.

808
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,028
I know.

809
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,118
I'm sorry you had to go
through that back there.

810
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,585
Here, have some
non-alcoholic eggnog.

811
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:28,815
I'll be fine.

812
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:32,551
You can't hide your feelings from me.
Let it out.

813
01:02:32,762 --> 01:02:34,127
Get it out of your system.

814
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,457
No, really, Ted, I'm okay.

815
01:02:36,833 --> 01:02:38,926
I don't think so.

816
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:44,672
You're like a lost, frightened foal.
I can see it in your eyes.

817
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,305
Don't worry.

818
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:48,037
Ted's here.

819
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:49,142
That's...

820
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:50,676
...very sweet.

821
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:53,445
You deserve better, Lizzie.

822
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:54,639
"Lizzie"?

823
01:02:54,851 --> 01:02:56,478
Someone you can talk to.

824
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,950
A shoulder to cry on.

825
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:13,195
It's useless, Liz. We can't
hide our feelings any longer.

826
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,368
Feelings?

827
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:16,469
I don't have to tell you...

828
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:19,334
...l'm a very eligible bachelor.

829
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:23,444
Lots of women would give anything
to be in your position.

830
01:03:23,646 --> 01:03:26,376
Well, I'm a lucky, lucky girl.

831
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:30,683
For me, it all started
months ago...

832
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:33,651
...at your Labor Day
barbecue, remember?

833
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:37,020
And you asked me
how to marinate ahi tuna?

834
01:03:37,227 --> 01:03:41,561
And I said, "All you need
is ltalian salad dressing."

835
01:03:53,743 --> 01:03:54,641
You!

836
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,210
Stop that man!

837
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,512
Enough talking.

838
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:10,924
That didn't go
as well as I'd hoped.

839
01:04:46,696 --> 01:04:47,856
You!

840
01:04:48,231 --> 01:04:50,256
Who are you? Are you the guy?

841
01:04:50,466 --> 01:04:52,457
Thank God. We got him, people!

842
01:04:52,702 --> 01:04:55,535
Listen. We're running late,
so pay attention.

843
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:59,435
We sent you an instruction manual
so you know the important controls.

844
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:04,238
I'll go over the changes. There are
three cutoff valves to the nitro.

845
01:05:04,581 --> 01:05:05,548
Here, here, here.

846
01:05:06,249 --> 01:05:09,480
The reading on the pressure
gauge should be below 50.

847
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:12,051
Not 70, like we told you earlier.

848
01:05:12,255 --> 01:05:13,916
The emergency cutoff is here.

849
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,051
The primary controls are here.

850
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:22,095
There's a microphone inside the
helmet to alter your voice properly.

851
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:25,563
Procedure-wise, it's
the same as we talked about.

852
01:05:25,768 --> 01:05:27,759
Stick to that,
there'll be no problems.

853
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:28,903
Questions?

854
01:05:29,105 --> 01:05:32,165
Before you say anything,
I speak for everyone...

855
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:34,740
...when I thank you for filling in.

856
01:05:35,678 --> 01:05:38,772
It was a total freak accident,
what happened at rehearsal.

857
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:41,644
We're confident we got
all the kinks out.

858
01:05:41,851 --> 01:05:46,481
You should know the doctor said Pete
showed some brain activity today.

859
01:05:46,956 --> 01:05:48,981
That's a really good sign.

860
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:52,289
Let's move it out, people!

861
01:05:52,862 --> 01:05:54,295
Finally!

862
01:05:54,530 --> 01:05:56,828
Where the hell have you been?

863
01:05:57,033 --> 01:06:00,264
I've been sweating like a dog
in a Chinese restaurant...

864
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:03,030
...waiting for your
sorry ass to show up!

865
01:06:03,239 --> 01:06:04,297
Well...

866
01:06:04,707 --> 01:06:06,504
...it's showtime!

867
01:06:07,543 --> 01:06:08,840
I know you.

868
01:06:09,045 --> 01:06:10,171
You're Booster.

869
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:13,816
And who the hell do you think
you are, Mary Poppins?!

870
01:06:14,017 --> 01:06:16,212
Come on, come on, let's go!

871
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,414
Wait. Let's talk!

872
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:20,555
Have a great show!

873
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:28,864
And now...

874
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,795
...the moment you've all
been waiting for!

875
01:06:32,001 --> 01:06:33,901
Live and in person...

876
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,230
...Turbo Man!

877
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:07,734
Wave, you idiot!

878
01:07:08,438 --> 01:07:09,769
Wave!

879
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:25,114
This is cool.

880
01:07:26,756 --> 01:07:29,020
Look, Mom, it's Turbo Man!

881
01:07:35,898 --> 01:07:37,798
I could get into this.

882
01:08:00,723 --> 01:08:04,750
In a few moments Turbo Man will pick
a special child from the audience.

883
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:09,931
That child will be the winner of a
special edition Turbo Man doll.

884
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,931
You're supposed to be
holding this.

885
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:52,499
Hey, rock star!

886
01:08:52,708 --> 01:08:57,008
Be on your toes. Dementor's gonna
jump on the float soon.

887
01:09:04,487 --> 01:09:06,148
What's he doing?

888
01:09:06,456 --> 01:09:08,356
Would you pick a kid already?

889
01:09:09,492 --> 01:09:10,823
Pick a kid?

890
01:09:11,027 --> 01:09:15,123
Pick a kid so he can come
up here and get his prize!

891
01:09:20,203 --> 01:09:21,830
Pick me! Pick me!

892
01:09:22,038 --> 01:09:23,027
Over here!

893
01:09:24,674 --> 01:09:26,733
-He's looking at me.
-No, me.

894
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,004
-He's pointing at me.
-No, me.

895
01:09:32,215 --> 01:09:33,079
Me!

896
01:09:33,316 --> 01:09:34,715
Me!

897
01:09:37,487 --> 01:09:38,749
Jamie.

898
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:43,515
He knows my name!

899
01:09:54,670 --> 01:09:57,332
I think Turbo Man
has selected a winner.

900
01:09:57,673 --> 01:09:58,765
Go ahead.

901
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:01,475
Go, Jamie!

902
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:20,995
Merry Christmas, Jamie.

903
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:35,507
How did you know my name?

904
01:10:36,312 --> 01:10:37,745
Well, Jamie...

905
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:38,947
...you see...

906
01:10:39,248 --> 01:10:40,340
...l'm your fa...

907
01:10:47,356 --> 01:10:50,519
Oh, no, kids!
It's Turbo Man's archenemy...

908
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,091
...Dementor!

909
01:10:57,166 --> 01:10:58,463
Shut up!

910
01:10:59,969 --> 01:11:01,129
Was that in the script?

911
01:11:01,437 --> 01:11:04,406
All right, give me the doll
and nobody gets hurt!

912
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:06,000
Myron?

913
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:09,803
That's right, Turtle Man.
Thought you could outsmart me?

914
01:11:10,012 --> 01:11:12,572
Thought your suit idea
was so slick!

915
01:11:12,782 --> 01:11:13,840
But you know what?

916
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:17,985
I'm one step ahead of you
because I have a bigger brain!

917
01:11:18,187 --> 01:11:19,677
Just stay here.

918
01:11:21,424 --> 01:11:24,450
Come on, Myron.
You're taking this too far.

919
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,026
I'm not going home
without that doll!

920
01:11:28,030 --> 01:11:30,760
Hey, this ain't
the way we rehearsed it!

921
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:33,931
You know what?
Nobody likes you, Booster.

922
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:38,766
We don't like you!

923
01:11:38,975 --> 01:11:40,670
We hate you, Booster!

924
01:11:41,978 --> 01:11:43,104
Where are you going?

925
01:11:43,312 --> 01:11:46,645
Come back, my little pretty,
and your little doll too!

926
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:48,043
Hey, Myron!

927
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:49,114
Leave him alone!

928
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:52,112
Ta-ta, Turtle Man!

929
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:05,158
Uh-oh, Liza! It looks like
Dementor has beaten Turbo Man.

930
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:09,235
This could be the end
of civilization as we know it.

931
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:13,303
Do something, Turbo Man!
Use your Turbo Disks!

932
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:14,339
My what?

933
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:15,475
On your arm!

934
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:21,144
Hey, man! I have a
special delivery for you!

935
01:12:36,265 --> 01:12:39,530
It appears that Turbo Man
has saved the day.

936
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,704
I'll take you back to your mom.

937
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:44,770
Go, Demon Team!

938
01:12:45,007 --> 01:12:47,874
It's the Demon Team,
Dementor's evil henchmen!

939
01:12:48,077 --> 01:12:49,510
What'll you do now?

940
01:12:57,119 --> 01:12:58,609
What about my son?

941
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:00,412
Don't you know the choreography?

942
01:13:05,194 --> 01:13:06,718
I ain't through with you!

943
01:13:10,433 --> 01:13:11,559
Get out of my way!

944
01:13:19,542 --> 01:13:21,772
Come here.
I'm sorry I hollered!

945
01:13:21,977 --> 01:13:22,944
Get out of my way!

946
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:27,743
Get out of my way!
Come here, boy!

947
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:29,784
Get this popcorn away!

948
01:13:33,823 --> 01:13:36,223
You know what?
You need a time-out.

949
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:41,394
Don't worry, it's part of the show.
Stay on the sidewalk.

950
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:42,621
That's my son.

951
01:13:42,832 --> 01:13:44,390
Oh, he's wonderful.

952
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:46,567
He's not part of the show!

953
01:13:48,404 --> 01:13:52,135
I'm scared of heights.
You ever see the movie Vertigo?

954
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,166
Let's get him!

955
01:14:03,385 --> 01:14:04,716
I want to talk to you!

956
01:14:08,124 --> 01:14:11,150
All right, kid, end of the line!
Give me the doll!

957
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:12,793
Never!

958
01:14:23,205 --> 01:14:25,765
Fly, Turbo Man! Use your jet pack!

959
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:36,050
It's Turbo Time!

960
01:15:13,989 --> 01:15:17,015
I think I'm getting the hang of this!

961
01:15:22,598 --> 01:15:24,657
Turbo Man, help!

962
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:25,992
I got you!

963
01:15:30,573 --> 01:15:31,938
Out of my way!

964
01:15:56,232 --> 01:15:57,256
Let us pray.

965
01:16:22,224 --> 01:16:23,156
I got you, kid!

966
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:38,270
Give me the doll.

967
01:16:42,678 --> 01:16:45,340
Turbo Man!
Use your Turbo-rang!

968
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:47,509
Come on!

969
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:52,676
Missed me!

970
01:16:59,094 --> 01:17:00,584
Victory is mine!

971
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:03,126
V-l-C-T-O-R-Y!

972
01:17:15,978 --> 01:17:17,673
I got it! I got one!

973
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:20,041
I finally got one!

974
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:29,055
Turbo Man! Help!

975
01:17:36,932 --> 01:17:37,796
Got you!

976
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:44,362
Thanks, Turbo Man.
I knew you'd save me.

977
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:47,041
You can always count on me.

978
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:08,228
Awesome!

979
01:18:14,903 --> 01:18:16,234
Here you go, ma'am.

980
01:18:16,672 --> 01:18:19,698
Did you see that?
I was flying with Turbo Man!

981
01:18:19,908 --> 01:18:23,935
He saved me from Dementor.
It was the coolest! Did you see?

982
01:18:24,179 --> 01:18:26,409
I saw. I saw.

983
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:31,280
Thank you. You don't know
how much he means to me.

984
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,681
Oh, I think I have an idea.

985
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:38,192
What's the matter?

986
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:41,830
It's just... I wish Dad
could've been here, you know?

987
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:43,999
To see me fly and all.

988
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,064
But he didn't come.

989
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:48,065
And it's all my fault.

990
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:49,601
He's mad at me.

991
01:18:49,805 --> 01:18:53,866
We had a fight on the phone
and I kind of yelled at him.

992
01:18:54,643 --> 01:18:56,975
Your dad is not mad at you.

993
01:18:57,246 --> 01:19:00,807
He loves you more
than anything in the world.

994
01:19:01,116 --> 01:19:03,243
You're his all-time
favorite person!

995
01:19:03,852 --> 01:19:05,319
How do you know that?

996
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:08,045
Well, who would know better than...

997
01:19:08,557 --> 01:19:09,489
...me?

998
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:11,092
Dad?

999
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:12,282
Howard?

1000
01:19:12,494 --> 01:19:13,961
Right here.

1001
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,730
You two mean more to me
than anything.

1002
01:19:19,935 --> 01:19:22,597
I'm sorry I haven't
shown that lately.

1003
01:19:23,005 --> 01:19:25,473
I know I've been
neglecting both of you.

1004
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:27,139
But no more.

1005
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:30,140
I love you. I love you both!

1006
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,441
What's going on here?

1007
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:35,140
Jamie's dad is Turbo Man!

1008
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:36,681
Let's get out of here!

1009
01:19:36,919 --> 01:19:37,977
You smell like barf!

1010
01:19:40,756 --> 01:19:44,624
Young man, I have something
that belongs to you.

1011
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:47,651
Thanks!

1012
01:19:47,863 --> 01:19:48,955
You're welcome.

1013
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:50,153
As for you...

1014
01:19:50,966 --> 01:19:53,935
...we could use
a man like you on the force.

1015
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,302
Thanks.

1016
01:19:56,605 --> 01:19:58,596
I'll keep that in mind.

1017
01:20:00,109 --> 01:20:02,543
I'm sorry about the bike.

1018
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,337
And the coffee.

1019
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:07,376
And the bus.

1020
01:20:07,583 --> 01:20:08,777
And the...

1021
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:10,075
...bomb.

1022
01:20:10,419 --> 01:20:11,579
Bomb?

1023
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:13,947
I had it right here in my hands.

1024
01:20:14,323 --> 01:20:16,814
What do I tell my son
on Christmas morning?

1025
01:20:17,092 --> 01:20:18,787
How will I look him in the eye?

1026
01:20:18,994 --> 01:20:20,086
Wait!

1027
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:22,763
Did you see? I had it!
I was so close.

1028
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:26,625
Merry Christmas.

1029
01:20:31,974 --> 01:20:33,839
Thank you. Thank you!

1030
01:20:35,777 --> 01:20:38,109
This'll make my son really happy.

1031
01:20:38,447 --> 01:20:40,813
I'm sorry about that
tension on the roof.

1032
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:42,374
It's cool.

1033
01:20:43,519 --> 01:20:47,785
But, Jamie, I thought you wanted
this doll more than anything.

1034
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,824
What do I need the doll for?
I got the real Turbo Man at home.

1035
01:20:53,228 --> 01:20:54,388
Turbo Man!

1036
01:20:54,897 --> 01:20:56,524
That's my husband.

1037
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:57,960
Turbo Man!

1038
01:21:03,138 --> 01:21:06,801
That's my dad!
That's my dad!

1039
01:28:55,977 --> 01:28:58,104
Look at that. There it is!

1040
01:28:58,313 --> 01:28:59,507
Beautiful.

1041
01:28:59,781 --> 01:29:01,112
Perfecto!

1042
01:29:06,388 --> 01:29:08,049
I've been thinking.

1043
01:29:08,323 --> 01:29:12,123
Everything you went through today
shows how much you love Jamie.

1044
01:29:13,995 --> 01:29:18,728
And if you're willing to go through
all of that just for a present...

1045
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,225
...that makes me wonder...

1046
01:29:22,470 --> 01:29:23,664
What?

1047
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:27,171
What did you get me?
