1
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:58,183
Between the time when
the oceans drank Atlantis...

2
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,979
and the rise
of the sons of Aryas,

3
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,440
there was an age undreamed of;

4
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,402
and unto this, Conan,

5
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:12,406
destined to bear the jewelled
crown of Aquilonia...

6
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,950
upon a troubled brow.

7
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,619
It is I, his chronicler,

8
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,622
who alone can tell thee
of his saga.

9
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:26,128
Let me tell you of the days
of high adventure.

10
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,461
Fire and wind
come from the sky,

11
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,255
from the gods of the sky.

12
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:17,257
But Crom is your god.

13
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,427
Crom, and he lives
in the Earth.

14
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:24,640
Once giants lived
in the Earth, Conan.

15
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,476
And in the darkness
of chaos...

16
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,478
they fooled Crom,

17
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:32,773
and they took from him
the enigma of steel.

18
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,816
Crom was angered,

19
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,818
and the Earth shook.

20
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,321
And fire and wind
struck down these giants,

21
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,115
and they threw their bodies
into the waters.

22
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:45,118
But in their rage,

23
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,998
the gods forgot the secret
of steel and left it
on the battlefield.

24
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,085
And we who found it...

25
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,587
are just men.

26
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:59,800
Not gods. Not giants.

27
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,220
Just men.

28
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:07,641
And the secret of steel
has always carried with it
a mystery.

29
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:10,018
You must learn its riddle,
Conan.

30
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,688
You must learn its discipline.

31
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,690
For no one,

32
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,776
no one in this world
can you trust;

33
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,488
not men, not women,
not beasts.

34
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,327
This you can trust.

35
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,389
Conan!

36
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,842
Kill that one first!

37
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,189
No! No!

38
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,200
Over there!

39
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,667
You! Get him!

40
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,688
The ashes were trampled
into the Earth,

41
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,357
and the blood became as snow.

42
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,151
Who knows what they came for?

43
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:42,155
Weapons of steel?
Or murder?

44
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:47,202
It was never known,
for the leader rode
to the south...

45
00:13:47,286 --> 00:13:51,206
while children went north
with the Vanir.

46
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,209
No one would ever know...

47
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:58,213
that my lord's people
had lived at all.

48
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:04,595
His was a tale of sorrow.

49
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:36,765
Sit here.

50
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:40,769
Sit here!

51
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,614
He did not care anymore:

52
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:03,203
Life and death, the same.

53
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:08,041
Only that the crowd
would be there...

54
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:13,088
to greet him with howls
of lust and fury.

55
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,759
He began to realize
his sense of worth.

56
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,554
He mattered.

57
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,589
In time,

58
00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:59,551
his victories could not
easily be counted.

59
00:20:59,635 --> 00:21:05,015
He was taken to the East,
a great prize,

60
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:09,978
where the warmasters
would teach him
the deepest secrets.

61
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,583
Hai!

62
00:21:34,002 --> 00:21:38,298
Language and writing
were made available:

63
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:43,136
the poetry of Kitai,
the philosophy of Sung.

64
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:54,982
And he also came to know
the pleasures of women...

65
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:59,528
when he was bred
to the finest stock.

66
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:12,017
But always there remained...

67
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,937
the discipline of steel.

68
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,076
My fear is that my sons
will never understand me.

69
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,082
We've won again!

70
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:39,127
This is good,
but what is best in life?

71
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:43,257
The open steppe,
a fleet horse,

72
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,342
falcons at your wrists...

73
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,095
and the wind in your hair.

74
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,138
Wrong!

75
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:52,641
Conan, what is best
in life?

76
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:55,936
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you...

77
00:23:55,978 --> 00:23:58,939
and to hear the lamentation
of their women.

78
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,942
That is good.
That is good.

79
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:42,733
Go! Go! You're free!

80
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,989
Go!

81
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:51,033
It has been surmised...

82
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:54,703
that perhaps my lord
was like a wild animal...

83
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,164
that had been kept too long.

84
00:24:57,206 --> 00:25:00,459
Perhaps.
But whatever, freedom,

85
00:25:00,542 --> 00:25:05,172
so long an unremembered
dream, was his.

86
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:08,290
Crom.

87
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:35,294
There's warmth and fire.

88
00:30:38,213 --> 00:30:43,343
Do you not wish to warm
yourself by my fire?

89
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:35,562
They said
you would come.

90
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:43,237
From the north,
a man of great strength.

91
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:47,950
A conqueror.

92
00:31:49,326 --> 00:31:53,622
A man who would someday
be king by his own hand.

93
00:31:55,499 --> 00:32:00,128
- One who would crush
the snakes of the Earth--
- Snakes? Did you say snakes?

94
00:32:05,926 --> 00:32:08,387
What is it you seek?

95
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,556
A standard.

96
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:14,476
A symbol,
perhaps on a shield.

97
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:18,188
Two snakes coming together.

98
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,650
Facing each other.

99
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,652
But they're one.

100
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:26,780
With... with a sun...

101
00:32:26,864 --> 00:32:28,824
and a moon below.

102
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:33,203
Black sun,
Black moon.

103
00:32:33,287 --> 00:32:35,414
Yes.

104
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,460
There's a price,
barbarian.

105
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,594
Zamora.

106
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,183
The... crossroads...

107
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:56,518
of the world.

108
00:32:56,602 --> 00:33:00,606
You will...

109
00:33:00,689 --> 00:33:06,486
find... what...
you want...

110
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,782
in Zamora.

111
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,452
Ohh!

112
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,558
Crom!

113
00:34:40,122 --> 00:34:42,040
Food.

114
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:45,085
Food!

115
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:53,093
I have not eaten for days.

116
00:34:55,888 --> 00:34:58,807
And who says you will?

117
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:05,647
Give me food so I have strength
when the wolves come.

118
00:35:05,731 --> 00:35:10,152
Let me die not in hunger,

119
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:12,154
but in combat.

120
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:14,281
Who are you?

121
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,994
I am Subotai,

122
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:21,997
thief and archer.

123
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,876
I am Hyrkanian,
the great order of Kerlait.

124
00:35:25,959 --> 00:35:29,087
So what are you
doing here?

125
00:35:29,171 --> 00:35:31,089
Dinner for wolves.

126
00:35:36,094 --> 00:35:39,014
What gods do you pray to?

127
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:45,187
I pray
to the four winds.

128
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,648
And you?

129
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,650
To Crom.

130
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:56,573
But I seldom pray to him.

131
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,700
He doesn't listen.

132
00:36:00,786 --> 00:36:02,788
What good is he, then?

133
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:06,291
Ah, it's just
as I've always said.

134
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:08,335
He is strong.

135
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,712
If I die,
I have to go before him,

136
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,716
and he will ask me,
"What is the riddle of steel?"

137
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:18,846
If I don't know it,
he will cast me out
of Valhalla and laugh at me.

138
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,348
That's Crom.
Strong on his mountain.

139
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:25,102
Ah, my god is greater.

140
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:28,021
Ha-ha! Crom laughs
at your four winds,

141
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:30,065
Laughs from his mountain.

142
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:33,193
My god is stronger.

143
00:36:33,277 --> 00:36:36,780
He is
the everlasting sky.

144
00:36:36,864 --> 00:36:39,700
Your god lives
underneath him.

145
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:23,035
Civilization,

146
00:37:23,118 --> 00:37:25,037
ancient and wicked.

147
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,039
Have you ever
seen this before?

148
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:30,125
No.
Let's waste no time!

149
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:53,482
It's good.
You have no idea
how long it's been there.

150
00:37:53,565 --> 00:37:57,903
So much meat... stink.

151
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:00,906
Does it always
smell like this?

152
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:03,367
How does the wind
ever get in here?

153
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:43,156
How about two snakes
coming together
over a black sun?

154
00:38:43,198 --> 00:38:45,242
A magnificent standard.

155
00:38:45,325 --> 00:38:49,913
The only snakes I know of
are those of Set
and those cursed towers.

156
00:38:49,997 --> 00:38:52,082
They have spread
to every city.

157
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:56,545
Two or three years ago,
it was just another snake cult.
Now, everywhere.

158
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:59,047
It is said that
they are deceivers.

159
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:03,218
They murder people
in the night.
I know nothing.

160
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,345
Hey.

161
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,395
Black lotus.
Stygian, the best.

162
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:15,814
This better not be Haga.

163
00:39:15,898 --> 00:39:19,193
I would sell Haga
to a slayer
such as you?

164
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:22,654
A pittance
to protect you
from evil.

165
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:24,656
I am evil.

166
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,658
They're all sluts!

167
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,912
He's dead already.

168
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:37,711
Can you believe that?
Huh?

169
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:40,380
Can you b--

170
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,348
You're too big
to be a thief.

171
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,022
Come. Let's leave
this place.

172
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:05,030
You're looking for snakes.

173
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,908
They live in
the Tower of the Serpent,

174
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:12,246
said to have riches without end
and the greatest jewel of all:

175
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,748
the Eye of the Serpent.

176
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,585
Chew it slowly!
It's the good stuff.

177
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,170
You are not a guard.

178
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,672
Neither are you.

179
00:41:03,755 --> 00:41:06,508
We are thieves...
Like yourself.

180
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:09,511
We come to climb the tower.

181
00:41:09,595 --> 00:41:13,348
You don't even have a rope.

182
00:41:13,432 --> 00:41:17,144
Two fools
who laugh at death.

183
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:20,022
Do you know what horrors
lie beyond that wall?

184
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:21,690
No.

185
00:41:25,027 --> 00:41:26,987
Then you go first.

186
00:42:11,907 --> 00:42:16,036
Ohh! What on Earth
could smell so bad?

187
00:42:16,078 --> 00:42:18,872
Do you want
to live forever?

188
00:42:58,579 --> 00:43:00,831
That one.

189
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:03,876
He's the High Priest,
second only to Thulsa Doom.

190
00:43:03,959 --> 00:43:06,920
They say Thulsa Doom's
a thousand years old.

191
00:43:10,632 --> 00:43:14,052
I'll see what's here.
Go find out what's below.

192
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,815
Infidels!

193
00:47:50,162 --> 00:47:52,581
Infidels!

194
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:17,397
Ahh! Kill them!

195
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:25,697
Do you want to live forever?

196
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:29,650
All manner of pleasures
and diversions were indulged.

197
00:52:29,691 --> 00:52:34,571
Wealth can be wonderful.

198
00:52:34,655 --> 00:52:39,409
But you know,
success can test one's mettle...

199
00:52:39,493 --> 00:52:44,206
as surely as
the strongest adversary.

200
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:12,818
They were taken to the hall
of King Osric the Usurper,

201
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:17,447
once a powerful Northman
like my lord...

202
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:20,868
but now old and sotted.

203
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:28,208
These are the thieves
you have requested, Sire.

204
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:30,419
I thought there were three.

205
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:35,591
O-O-Our companion,
he died in the gardens.
Lions ate him.

206
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:37,384
Lions ate him?

207
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:47,978
The lions ate him.

208
00:53:57,112 --> 00:53:59,281
Do you know
what you've done?

209
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:07,206
Why, Rexor himself
has come before me,
threatened me, a king!

210
00:54:07,289 --> 00:54:10,167
What daring!
What outrageousness!

211
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,628
What insolence!
What arrogance!

212
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:22,888
I salute you.

213
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,647
Thulsa Doom.

214
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,234
I've chafed for years
at this demigod.

215
00:54:35,317 --> 00:54:38,362
Snakes in my beautiful city.

216
00:54:38,445 --> 00:54:41,865
To the west:
Nemedia, Aquilonia.

217
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:45,327
To the south:
Koth, Stygia, snakes.

218
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:48,121
Everywhere
these evil towers.

219
00:54:48,205 --> 00:54:50,624
You alone have stood up
to their gods.

220
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:54,419
And what are you?
Thieves!

221
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:02,928
See this?

222
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:07,808
They call it the
"Fangs of the Serpent. "

223
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:09,852
And this one...

224
00:55:09,893 --> 00:55:14,356
was thrust into a father's
heart by his very son.

225
00:55:15,899 --> 00:55:17,985
And my own daughter...

226
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:21,655
has fallen under this
Thulsa Doom's spell.

227
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:26,118
Is there a dagger
such as this...

228
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,537
in her hand for me?

229
00:55:30,873 --> 00:55:33,292
She follows him
as a slave,

230
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,879
seeking for the truth
of her soul...

231
00:55:36,962 --> 00:55:39,631
as if I could not
give it to her!

232
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:48,640
As we speak...

233
00:55:48,724 --> 00:55:51,643
my daughter travels east...

234
00:55:51,727 --> 00:55:55,647
to Thulsa Doom
and his Mountain of Power.

235
00:55:57,232 --> 00:56:00,652
She is to be his!

236
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:13,332
Steal my daughter back.
Take all you can carry.

237
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,547
There's more.
Much more.

238
00:56:20,631 --> 00:56:23,675
Enough to become
kings yourselves.

239
00:56:28,013 --> 00:56:30,724
There comes a time,
thief,

240
00:56:30,807 --> 00:56:34,019
when the jewels
cease to sparkle,

241
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:37,439
when the gold
loses its luster,

242
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:40,442
when the throne room
becomes a prison,

243
00:56:42,528 --> 00:56:44,613
and all that is left...

244
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:47,616
is a father's love
for his child.

245
00:56:54,456 --> 00:56:56,792
To the hell fires
with Thulsa Doom.

246
00:56:56,875 --> 00:57:00,462
He's evil, a sorcerer
who can summon demons.

247
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:05,384
His followers' only purpose
is to die in his service.

248
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,763
There are thousands
of them.

249
00:57:09,847 --> 00:57:14,309
This Mountain of Power
where he lives is said
to be impregnable.

250
00:57:16,728 --> 00:57:20,148
I have talked to Subotai
and he agrees.

251
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:23,318
Let's take what we have
while we live.

252
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,831
I have never had
so much as now.

253
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:40,127
All my life
I've been alone.

254
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:46,466
Many times I face my death
with no one to know.

255
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:53,015
I would look into the huts
and the tents of others
in the coldest dark...

256
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:57,019
and I would see figures
holding each other
in the night.

257
00:57:58,854 --> 00:58:01,481
But I always passed by.

258
00:58:05,194 --> 00:58:07,321
You and I...

259
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:10,032
we have warmth.

260
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:13,035
That's so hard to find
in this world.

261
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:19,291
Please, let someone else
pass by in the night.

262
00:58:21,335 --> 00:58:23,587
Let us take the world
by the throat...

263
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,423
and make it give us
what we desire.

264
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:52,277
The children of Doom.

265
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,655
Doom's children.

266
01:00:54,696 --> 01:00:59,660
They told my lord the way
to the Mountain of Power.

267
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:03,830
They told him
to throw down his sword...

268
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:06,333
and return to the earth.

269
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:08,669
Hah!

270
01:01:08,752 --> 01:01:12,506
Time enough for the earth
in the grave.

271
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:21,617
Ohhh!

272
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,786
Once great men lived here.

273
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:27,581
Giants, gods.

274
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:30,542
Once, but long ago.

275
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,844
It was here
that I met my master.

276
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:43,430
It was no accident.

277
01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,058
Noris it mere chance...

278
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:49,645
that I am the teller
of his tale.

279
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,940
Hey!

280
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,737
I'm a wizard, mind you.

281
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:02,157
This place is kept
by powerful gods...

282
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,493
and spirits of kings.

283
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:08,830
Harm my flesh, and you will
have to deal with the dead.

284
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:11,625
Can you summon demons,
wizard?

285
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,752
Yes!

286
01:03:13,836 --> 01:03:16,630
If I strike at you,
I would summon the demon...

287
01:03:16,713 --> 01:03:19,216
more ferocious
than all in hell!

288
01:03:37,276 --> 01:03:41,488
The mounds have been here
since the time of the Titans.

289
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:45,158
Kings buried in them.
Great kings.

290
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:49,830
Domains once glittered
like the light on a windy sea.

291
01:03:51,248 --> 01:03:55,836
Fire won't burn there.
No fire at all.

292
01:03:55,878 --> 01:04:00,340
That's why I live
down here in the wind.

293
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:04,344
Do you care
for these places?
I sing to them.

294
01:04:04,386 --> 01:04:06,847
On nights
when they wish...

295
01:04:06,889 --> 01:04:09,725
I sing of the tales
of battles,

296
01:04:09,808 --> 01:04:12,603
heroes, witches
and women.

297
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:15,522
Nobody bothers me
down here.

298
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:19,067
Not even... Thulsa Doom.

299
01:04:22,821 --> 01:04:24,865
Do flowers grow
around here?

300
01:04:24,948 --> 01:04:27,534
Flowers?

301
01:04:35,876 --> 01:04:37,794
Flowers.

302
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:42,341
You've not come here
as a pilgrim, have you?

303
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:45,469
Oil the sword
and feed the horse.

304
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:49,473
Have you ever ridden
one of those things before?

305
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:52,392
No!

306
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:58,815
Warrior!
What are the flowers for?

307
01:04:58,899 --> 01:05:02,236
For a girl.

308
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:28,053
Doom, doom, doom, doom

309
01:05:44,486 --> 01:05:46,780
Doom

310
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,869
Doom

311
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,373
Doom

312
01:06:59,603 --> 01:07:02,189
Where do you think
you're going, brother?

313
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:04,191
I'm afraid.

314
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:07,027
Afraid?
To bare yourself?

315
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,029
Why?

316
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,865
You're so big
and so well grown.

317
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:14,451
You should be proud
of your body.

318
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:17,037
How do you expect
to reach emptiness...

319
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,040
without knowing
your own body?

320
01:07:20,123 --> 01:07:23,001
Could we talk
over there...

321
01:07:23,085 --> 01:07:25,587
where the others
do not see?

322
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,340
Why, yes, brother.

323
01:07:28,423 --> 01:07:30,425
Of course.

324
01:07:43,355 --> 01:07:46,275
I'm afraid and I'm shy.

325
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,031
Is this, uh, your robe?
A priest's robe?

326
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:56,702
Yes, it's all I have.

327
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:59,037
Good.

328
01:08:01,957 --> 01:08:04,376
That's all you'll ever need.

329
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:11,884
Brother.

330
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:57,739
What do you see?

331
01:09:57,823 --> 01:10:00,826
Uh, infinity.

332
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:02,870
Good.

333
01:11:13,106 --> 01:11:15,776
I see you.

334
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,114
I have watched you.

335
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:25,285
For a thousand years
I have watched you.

336
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:29,665
Doom!

337
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:32,417
Doom!

338
01:11:34,002 --> 01:11:36,046
Doom!

339
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,343
Doom!

340
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:55,858
Who among you
still fears death?

341
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:59,903
Who will not face
emptiness?

342
01:11:59,987 --> 01:12:04,032
- Infidel!

343
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:06,011
I wish to speak
to you now.

344
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:15,687
Where is the
Eye of the Serpent?

345
01:13:19,483 --> 01:13:23,362
Rexor says that you
gave it to a girl.

346
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:26,698
Probably for a mere
night's pleasure.

347
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,452
What a loss.

348
01:13:31,828 --> 01:13:34,748
People have no grasp
of what they do.

349
01:13:36,625 --> 01:13:41,213
You broke into my house,
stole my property,

350
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:44,383
murdered my servants
and my pets.

351
01:13:44,466 --> 01:13:47,553
And that is what
grieves me the most!

352
01:13:47,594 --> 01:13:51,181
You killed my snake.

353
01:13:51,265 --> 01:13:55,018
Thorgen is beside himself
with grief.

354
01:13:56,436 --> 01:14:01,275
He raised that snake
from the time it wasborn.

355
01:14:05,821 --> 01:14:08,323
You killed my mother!

356
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:11,743
You killed my father!
You killed my people!

357
01:14:11,827 --> 01:14:15,706
You took my father's sword.

358
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:18,750
Ah.

359
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,628
It must have been
when I was younger.

360
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:25,841
There was a time, boy,
when I searched for steel,

361
01:14:25,924 --> 01:14:30,512
when steel meant more to me
than gold or jewels.

362
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:35,017
The riddle... of steel.

363
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,019
Yes.

364
01:14:37,102 --> 01:14:40,022
You know what it is,
don't you, boy?

365
01:14:40,105 --> 01:14:45,194
Shall I tell you?
It's the least I can do.

366
01:14:47,112 --> 01:14:49,907
Steel isn't strong, boy.

367
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:54,786
Flesh is stronger.
Look around you, here.

368
01:14:57,206 --> 01:15:00,209
There, on the rocks.

369
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:03,587
That beautiful girl.

370
01:15:03,670 --> 01:15:06,590
Come to me, my child.

371
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:19,269
That is strength, boy.

372
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:21,647
That is power.

373
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,983
The strength and power
of flesh.

374
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:29,196
What is steel compared to
the hand that wields it?

375
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,784
Look at the strength of your
body, the desire in your heart.

376
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:36,787
I gave you this.

377
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:39,331
Such a waste.

378
01:15:41,166 --> 01:15:45,629
Contemplate this
on the Tree of Woe.

379
01:15:51,927 --> 01:15:54,555
Crucify him.

380
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:58,113
He said you were a wizard.

381
01:18:58,197 --> 01:19:00,490
Do the gods
owe you any favors?

382
01:19:00,574 --> 01:19:02,201
Yeah.

383
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:06,121
There are dangers.

384
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:09,208
But I see you care
little for those.

385
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,878
The spirits of this place
extract a heavy toll.

386
01:19:12,961 --> 01:19:16,924
- Then I will pay them.

387
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:06,557
Drink.

388
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,229
Drink.

389
01:20:18,694 --> 01:20:22,656
Sometime soon,
perhaps tonight...

390
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:26,493
they'll try to take him,
and if they succeed--

391
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:29,496
If they succeed,
you'll follow.

392
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:39,691
No! No!

393
01:21:48,992 --> 01:21:51,912
Stop! Stop!

394
01:21:59,378 --> 01:22:03,048
Stop! No!

395
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:32,578
Stop! Stop!

396
01:23:02,024 --> 01:23:03,984
They're gone!

397
01:23:05,986 --> 01:23:08,280
They're gone!

398
01:24:01,708 --> 01:24:04,378
All the gods,
they cannot sever us.

399
01:24:04,461 --> 01:24:09,341
If I were dead, and you were
still fighting for life,
I'd come back for you.

400
01:24:09,383 --> 01:24:14,346
Back from the pit of hell
to fight at your side.

401
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:33,383
The old man says
the Mountain of Power
is hollow.

402
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:35,802
Thulsa Doom
lives in the mountain.

403
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:38,764
What else does he say?

404
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:42,267
That in the back of the mountain
there's a gorge.

405
01:25:42,309 --> 01:25:44,269
Many caves.

406
01:25:44,311 --> 01:25:48,607
Good thief could get in there.
Steal the princess.

407
01:25:48,649 --> 01:25:51,360
Be off before she's missed
in the darkness.

408
01:25:51,443 --> 01:25:54,988
Good thieves could do that,
but not vengeful ones.

409
01:25:58,617 --> 01:26:02,538
Only the girl.
We kill Thulsa Doom another day.

410
01:26:06,667 --> 01:26:08,627
Agreed?

411
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:13,298
Conan?

412
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:06,717
So this is paradise.

413
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,601
Princess.

414
01:34:10,776 --> 01:34:13,278
Yee-aah!
Uuh!

415
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,873
Yee-uuh!

416
01:35:16,383 --> 01:35:18,677
Get them!

417
01:35:33,609 --> 01:35:35,569
Come on!

418
01:35:43,660 --> 01:35:45,579
You.

419
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:00,654
Yee-ah!

420
01:38:00,255 --> 01:38:02,216
Help him.

421
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:10,849
Infidel defilers.

422
01:38:10,933 --> 01:38:15,437
They should all drown
in lakes of blood.

423
01:38:15,521 --> 01:38:19,566
Now they will know why
they are afraid of the dark.

424
01:38:19,650 --> 01:38:23,737
Now they will learn
why they fear the night.

425
01:38:57,855 --> 01:38:59,773
Seek.

426
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:21,628
Uuh!

427
01:39:50,199 --> 01:39:54,912
The Wizard-- I told him
I would pay the gods.

428
01:40:12,054 --> 01:40:14,014
Hold me.

429
01:40:16,517 --> 01:40:19,102
Kiss me.

430
01:40:19,186 --> 01:40:21,104
Kiss me.

431
01:40:26,485 --> 01:40:29,571
Let me breathe my last breath
into your mouth.

432
01:40:31,698 --> 01:40:33,659
I'm so cold.

433
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:41,708
So cold.

434
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:47,047
Keep... me...

435
01:40:49,842 --> 01:40:51,760
warm.

436
01:40:54,805 --> 01:40:56,723
Keep...

437
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:01,687
me... warm.

438
01:41:58,452 --> 01:42:03,040
Hey. Fire won't burn
up there. No fire at all.

439
01:42:40,827 --> 01:42:42,996
Why do you cry?

440
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:47,000
He is Conan. Cimmerian.

441
01:42:48,293 --> 01:42:50,212
He won't cry...

442
01:42:52,172 --> 01:42:54,925
so I cry for him.

443
01:44:19,843 --> 01:44:23,222
He will kill you!
He has seen your fires.

444
01:44:23,263 --> 01:44:27,809
He will come for me,
and when he does
he will kill you!

445
01:44:40,948 --> 01:44:46,912
I remember days like this,
when my father
took me to the forest...

446
01:44:46,995 --> 01:44:49,790
and we ate
wild blueberries.

447
01:44:49,873 --> 01:44:52,960
More than
20 years ago.

448
01:44:53,043 --> 01:44:56,672
I was just a boy
of four or five.

449
01:44:56,755 --> 01:45:02,135
The leaves
were so dark
and green then.

450
01:45:02,219 --> 01:45:06,723
The grass
smelled sweet
with the spring wind.

451
01:45:09,977 --> 01:45:12,980
Almost 20 years
of pitiless combat!

452
01:45:13,063 --> 01:45:17,484
No rest!
No sleep
like other men!

453
01:45:17,526 --> 01:45:21,613
And yet the spring wind
blows, Subotai.

454
01:45:21,697 --> 01:45:23,448
Have you ever felt
such a wind?

455
01:45:23,490 --> 01:45:28,287
They blow
where I live too.

456
01:45:28,328 --> 01:45:31,915
In the north
of every man's heart.

457
01:45:34,501 --> 01:45:36,670
It's never too late,
Subotai.

458
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:39,006
No!

459
01:45:41,508 --> 01:45:46,138
It would only
lead me back here
another day.

460
01:45:46,221 --> 01:45:49,099
In even worse company.

461
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:59,860
For us there is
no spring--

462
01:45:59,943 --> 01:46:04,615
just the wind
that smells fresh
before the storm.

463
01:46:52,871 --> 01:46:55,832
Hey, old man.
Where'd you get
this stuff?

464
01:46:55,916 --> 01:46:59,336
The dead. Our gods
are pleased with you.

465
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:03,298
They will watch
the battle. Heh!
Are they
going to help?

466
01:47:03,382 --> 01:47:07,636
No. 
Well, then tell them
to stay out of the way!

467
01:48:35,390 --> 01:48:37,809
Crom.

468
01:48:37,851 --> 01:48:43,023
I've never prayed to you before.
I have no tongue for it.

469
01:48:43,106 --> 01:48:46,527
No one,
not even you will remember...

470
01:48:46,568 --> 01:48:49,696
if we were good men
or bad.

471
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:53,742
Why we fought
or why we died. No.

472
01:48:53,825 --> 01:48:57,704
All that matters
is that two stood against many.

473
01:48:57,746 --> 01:49:00,290
That's what's important.

474
01:49:00,374 --> 01:49:05,712
Valor pleases you, Crom,
so grant me one request.

475
01:49:05,754 --> 01:49:10,217
Grant me revenge.

476
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:14,471
And if you do not listen,
then the hell with you!

477
01:50:29,630 --> 01:50:31,548
Aghh!

478
01:51:26,311 --> 01:51:28,230
Hey-ya! Heh!

479
01:51:44,788 --> 01:51:47,040
Yah!

480
01:51:51,378 --> 01:51:53,338
Yee-ee-ee-ah!

481
01:52:08,979 --> 01:52:10,981
Aaah!

482
01:52:11,064 --> 01:52:13,692
Yaah! Yaah!

483
01:52:13,775 --> 01:52:17,404
Aaa-aaa-aah!

484
01:52:39,593 --> 01:52:44,473
That's how we do it!
I did it with my
spear! Aha!

485
01:53:53,208 --> 01:53:55,752
Do you want
to live forever?

486
01:54:50,057 --> 01:54:52,017
Doom!

487
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:55,312
Don't leave me!
My Lord!

488
01:55:02,861 --> 01:55:05,906
No, don't kill me!

489
01:55:11,995 --> 01:55:14,581
Father!

490
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,460
Aaah!

491
01:55:20,295 --> 01:55:22,256
Ah!

492
01:55:25,759 --> 01:55:27,845
Yuck! Ecch!

493
01:56:22,065 --> 01:56:25,402
Doom! Doom!

494
01:57:38,058 --> 01:57:43,689
Purging is at last at hand.
Day of Doom is here.

495
01:57:49,403 --> 01:57:53,115
All that is evil:
all their allies.

496
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:55,868
Your parents,
your leaders:

497
01:57:55,951 --> 01:57:59,955
those who would call them selves
your judges.

498
01:58:00,038 --> 01:58:03,166
Those who have lied...

499
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:06,044
and corrupted the Earth.

500
01:58:06,086 --> 01:58:08,589
They shall all be cleansed.

501
01:58:08,672 --> 01:58:11,592
Doom!

502
01:58:13,010 --> 01:58:15,721
You, my children,
are the water...

503
01:58:15,804 --> 01:58:20,601
that will wash away
all that has gone before.

504
01:58:20,642 --> 01:58:24,563
In your hand
you hold my light.

505
01:58:24,605 --> 01:58:27,566
The gleam
in the eye of Set.

506
01:58:27,608 --> 01:58:31,862
This flame will burn away
the darkness;

507
01:58:31,945 --> 01:58:36,825
burn you the way
to paradise!

508
01:58:36,909 --> 01:58:38,952
Doom! Doom!

509
01:59:12,903 --> 01:59:15,531
My child.

510
01:59:15,614 --> 01:59:18,534
You have come to me,
my son.

511
01:59:20,160 --> 01:59:23,539
For who now is your father
if it is not me?

512
01:59:23,622 --> 01:59:27,501
Who gave you
the will to live?

513
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:34,132
I am the well spring
from which you flow.

514
01:59:35,592 --> 01:59:40,222
When I am gone,
you will have never been.

515
01:59:42,391 --> 01:59:46,520
What will your world be
without me...

516
01:59:50,899 --> 01:59:53,277
my son?
