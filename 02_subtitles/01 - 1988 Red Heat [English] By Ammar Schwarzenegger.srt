3
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,594
This is not
a foundry worker's hand.

4
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:22,700
If you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.

5
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,415
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

6
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,379
He left!

7
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,609
Where?

8
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,753
Druzhba Cafe!

9
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,579
It's getting harder.

10
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:07,055
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.

11
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,820
Another ten years,
it'll be like Miami.

12
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:11,429
It'll never happen.

13
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,429
You're wrong.

14
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,457
You know your new nickname?

15
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,331
The officers
called you Iron Jaw...

16
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,995
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.

17
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,937
Actually,
I'm circumcised myself.

18
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:30,439
How's your cold?

19
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:34,484
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?

20
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,487
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

21
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:41,855
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.

22
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,494
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.

23
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,962
Let's get them.

24
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,758
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.

25
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,193
Let's go. All of you.

26
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:31,436
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?

27
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:37,670
We are just simple people.

28
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:44,015
Maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.

29
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,549
What's this country coming to?!

30
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:50,048
This is like old days!

31
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,385
We are not guilty of anything!

32
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,527
Where is your evidence?

33
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,036
I got his brother in the leg.

34
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,586
Freeze! You are under arrest!

35
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,946
Drop your gun!

36
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,614
Now!

37
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:43,861
Handcuffs would be a good idea.

38
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:02,330
our informants...

39
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:07,946
...say Rosta fled the country
with two other criminals...

40
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,349
...Josip Baroda
and Pytor Tatamovich.

41
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,179
We'll find him.

42
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,053
He'll pay for his crimes
against the people.

43
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:09,240
Abdul Elijah says we're in business.
Get the capital in safe place, okay?

44
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:13,469
Meet me back here 3..00. Bring me a key.
We go check the color of your green.

45
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:18,015
Your shipment's on its way. You have a
small item for me. I give you a courier.

46
00:15:18,183 --> 00:15:20,674
Bless Abdul Elijah
and the brotherhood.

47
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,344
Nice doing business, comrade.

48
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:56,985
We're in business.

49
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,095
oh! Attention!

50
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:10,827
Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 1 1 :00.

51
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:12,994
Whew, Christ!

52
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,400
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.

53
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:20,739
I think those
are definitely home grown.

54
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,437
Art!

55
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,417
Just an opinion.

56
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,013
Jesus!

57
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,487
-Guy's gotta be dead not to notice that.
-What's the matter with you?

58
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,593
I'm a man. I got needs.

59
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,854
We're on the job. Come on.

60
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,756
We oughta arrest her.

61
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:50,101
- What'd you squeeze him with?
- Caught him packin' on parole.

62
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,436
Gave him a choice:
Whisper in my ear...

63
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:54,977
or I turn him intoJoliet Prison
for five years.

64
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,172
He tipped you to
a big cleanhead deal?

65
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,910
Don't tell me we're popping cleanheads.
I hate the cleanheads!

66
00:17:01,086 --> 00:17:03,281
You're this close
to losing your job.

67
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:06,652
Can you give us a second, Charlie?

68
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,656
Yeah, all right.

69
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:12,957
You're not helping yourself.

70
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,600
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy Streak.

71
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,171
All right. Come on, let's go.

72
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:35,047
Freeze! Police! Hands up!

73
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,449
Shut up!

74
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,785
You ain't got shit!

75
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:51,564
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.

76
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,831
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

77
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,109
outside stairwell!

78
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,542
Freeze, motherfucker!

79
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,680
Don't get nervous.
I do this for a living.

80
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:42,410
You look like Marvin Hagler.

81
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,555
I lost money on Hagler!

82
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,705
Hey! How long you gonna be in there?
You're not even using the goddamn phone!

83
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,007
Jerk.

84
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:18,516
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.

85
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,717
We'll take extreme precaution.

86
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,782
Take this to Colonel Kulikov
immediately.

87
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,926
Then send for Captain Danko.

88
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,994
He is to report as soon as possible.

89
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,996
Good news, Comrade.

90
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,996
America.

91
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,362
America.

92
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:40,130
Chicago. Gangsters.

93
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:55,476
You are being given
a great responsibility, Captain.

94
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,420
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offence.

95
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,593
His two accomplices
are still at large.

96
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:10,461
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.

97
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,263
our informants say
five million dollar's worth.

98
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,170
Bring Victor home.

99
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,003
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.

100
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,306
I repeat,
tell the Americans nothing.

101
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:26,240
Do not discuss our problems.

102
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,283
Bring Viktor to us.

103
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,080
We will avenge Yuri...

104
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,716
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the West.

105
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,323
Trust me.

106
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,647
- How you doing, honey?
- Blow yourself.

107
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,877
Thank you. Thank you very much.
It's good thinking.

108
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,653
Should be out any second.

109
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,452
He's going through customs
right now.

110
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,188
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?

111
00:22:12,364 --> 00:22:16,391
- He says your performance was adequate.
- Adequate.Jesus Christ! What a jerk!

112
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,866
It's a personality thing.

113
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,937
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

114
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,914
Ten to one he doesn't speak English.

115
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,079
- Captain Danko.
- Yes.

116
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,850
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.

117
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,085
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

118
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,662
This is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.

119
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,534
- First time in Chicago?
- Yes.

120
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,763
You have a nice flight?

121
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,407
Yes, fine.

122
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,569
- You hungry?
- No.

123
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:01,007
Thirsty?

124
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:05,616
Hate to break this up, but I'm parked
in a red zone. No offense.

125
00:23:07,252 --> 00:23:09,413
We got a car waiting outside
for you.

126
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,614
It's a half-hour drive
to the city.

127
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:15,726
It's a nice drive.
You'll enjoy it.

128
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,462
Nice night.

129
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,294
Been real hot lately. Nothing hotter
than Chicago in August.

130
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:26,198
It's the humidity
that gets to you.

131
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,406
Humidity. You know,
moisture in the air.

132
00:23:33,879 --> 00:23:35,608
How's it been in Moscow?

133
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,408
Hot.

134
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,607
No moisture.

135
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,583
Where'd you learn
to speak English so well?

136
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,619
Army.

137
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,953
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.

138
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:51,459
oh, yeah. That's like
in Chicken Kiev.

139
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,531
We had that at my sister's wedding.

140
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:59,232
Viktor Rosta must've pissed off
a lot of commissars...

141
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,931
for them to send someone
all this way to baby-sit him home.

142
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,770
What did he do?
Pee on the Kremlin?

143
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,448
I gotta apologize
for my partner, Captain.

144
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,812
He's just naturally suspicious.

145
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,578
Did you arrest Viktor?

146
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:21,021
- Me? It was patrolmen.
- Where?

147
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:23,957
Right near his hotel,
The Garvin.

148
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,155
It's a breeding ground for pushers,
pimps, prostitutes.

149
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:29,459
Take me there.

150
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,569
We got you booked
at the Executive House.

151
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,932
Please. Garvin.

152
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,638
You sure you wanna stay here?
It's horrible. You have a choice.

153
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,340
I stay here.

154
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,044
- If you're on a budget--
- Thank you.

155
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:52,281
I will be fine.

156
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:55,386
You're the boss.

157
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,496
I'll pick you up
at 9:00 in the morning.

158
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:03,567
Nice talking to you, Captain.

159
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:12,575
- What do you think?
- I think he's a jerk.

160
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:23,247
- Danko.
- You're welcome.

161
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,566
Put your name in the big book
right there.

162
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:42,968
You had man here called ''Rosta.''

163
00:25:43,141 --> 00:25:45,302
Viktor Rosta.

164
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,275
- A Russian?
- Soviet.

165
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:50,778
I want same room.

166
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:52,416
Are you Russian too?

167
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,087
Nice going.

168
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,624
It's 302.

169
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,862
Right up those stairs.

170
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:00,817
Capitalism.

171
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,333
This is our booking area.

172
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,441
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?

173
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:33,175
When I first got here
when I was first assigned here...

174
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:35,683
I thought all hell
had broken loose.

175
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:41,024
Nope. It was just
a typical Monday morning.

176
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,353
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

177
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:46,530
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.

178
00:27:46,731 --> 00:27:49,359
- Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,401
Not king.

180
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,305
Checkmate in two moves.

181
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:58,033
Use bishop to queen four.

182
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,474
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but I think I got it covered.

183
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,109
This way, Captain.

184
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,214
The nerve of that guy.

185
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,255
Captain Danko, Moscow Militia.

186
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:14,324
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.

187
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,723
Thanks, Tom. The Captain
will be with you in a minute.

188
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:26,165
This is an extradition order.
It only requires your signature.

189
00:28:26,337 --> 00:28:28,965
He ran a red light.
No driver's license.

190
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,632
The officer found a gun in
his glove box, so he brought him in.

191
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,245
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.

192
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:39,975
When we found the cyrillic writing
tattoo, we figured he was one of yours.

193
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,582
Viktor did not ask
for political asylum?

194
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,417
I think he wants to go home.

195
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,827
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik.

196
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,828
Right.

197
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,933
Stress management.
You watch the fishes.

198
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,873
You water the plants.

199
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:10,242
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.

200
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,781
Listen to pleasant sounds.

201
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:17,017
Relax.

202
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,680
Personally, I think it
may all be a pile of shit!

203
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,727
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.

204
00:29:27,632 --> 00:29:28,690
Look...

205
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:33,201
just out of curiosity, and since
I figure cops are cops everywhere...

206
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,466
how do you Soviets deal
with all the stress?

207
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,600
Vodka.

208
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,911
Yes, sir.

209
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:48,348
I want you to ride with Gallagher
and the Captain to the city jail.

210
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,047
Make sure he signs this form
before they go to the airport.

211
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,691
Then bring the top copy back.

212
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:58,022
Just bring the top form
back to me.

213
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,191
- Yes, sir.
- That'll make it official.

214
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,302
So long, Captain.
Nice doing business with you.

215
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,303
- Gallagher! Taxi service.
- Right.

216
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:21,544
Stand up.

217
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,291
I'm taking you home.

218
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:33,496
Eat shit.

219
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:39,769
You can tell they're old buddies.
Body language is a beautiful thing.

220
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,971
We are ready.

221
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,666
Yes, sir.

222
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,422
What is this key to?

223
00:31:01,826 --> 00:31:03,726
Kiss my ass.

224
00:31:05,096 --> 00:31:08,691
- Do you know what this key opens?
- Looks like a locker key.

225
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,062
Why don't you ask your bud?

226
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,735
You try it.

227
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,674
Where is the locker...

228
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:26,305
that this key opens?

229
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,913
- What'd he say?
- He say...

230
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,184
''Go and kiss your mother's behind.''

231
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,824
You son of a bitch!
Come here!

232
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,831
Motherfucker!

233
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,833
- Take it easy!
- I'm fine!

234
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:52,602
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine. Happens all the time.

235
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:55,803
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.

236
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,185
- Have you seen my mother's ass?
- No, I haven't.

237
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,252
Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

238
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,160
He shouldn't have said that
about my mom.

239
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:16,698
What do you care? It's not your case.
It's not my case.

240
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,928
- It's not even an American case.
- Right, right.

241
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,904
We're just an escort service here.
Pull back on your emotions.

242
00:32:24,075 --> 00:32:26,339
How can I let what he said pass?

243
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:29,036
Find a middle ground.

244
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,147
This way, clown.

245
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:48,198
All right, I'm outta here.

246
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,698
Look, Captain,
have a good flight back.

247
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:54,031
If you get a chance to flush
this turd down the toilet...

248
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:56,639
do it over the Pole.

249
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,300
By the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.

250
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,844
It was obvious.

251
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,455
Forgive Ridzik, Captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.

252
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:17,355
- Put himself in a jam--
- I try to forget Ridzik.

253
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,962
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:31,267
Give me a Sun Times and
a Racing Action tip sheet.

255
00:33:31,442 --> 00:33:33,342
You got a winner?

256
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:50,722
Move!

257
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,760
- Come on, let's go!
- The key!

258
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:58,457
Come on, man!

259
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,160
Let's go! Let's move!

260
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,768
- How's he doing, Doctor?
- It's still early.

261
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:18,005
There's no fracture,
but Danko does have a concussion.

262
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,776
We're gonna need him
to make a full statement.

263
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:24,250
I don't think you should expect
much out of him today.

264
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,446
Thank you very much.

265
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,777
Gallagher didn't even
get a shot off.

266
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,448
I think it was the cleanheads
who did it.

267
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,244
That's possible. They all walked
yesterday morning. Illegal warrant.

268
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:57,387
Even the guy with the shotgun?

269
00:35:57,555 --> 00:36:00,683
Walked right out the door
with a handshake from the judge.

270
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:02,485
- Shit.
- Listen to this.

271
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,426
This guy you shot there,
according to his I.D., he's Russian.

272
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:08,292
Can you believe that?

273
00:36:08,466 --> 00:36:12,425
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.

274
00:36:12,737 --> 00:36:14,932
I am Moussorsky,
your liaison officer.

275
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,271
We're here from Washington.

276
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:21,067
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.

277
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,971
We need to know what happened.

278
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,648
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.

279
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,851
There's nothing to report.

280
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,851
Your attitude is disappointing.

281
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,719
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.

282
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,588
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.

283
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,230
Rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.

284
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:47,895
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home...

285
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:50,506
...through his Georgian network.

286
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,968
We are humiliated
before the world.

287
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,711
You've failed.

288
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,209
Report whatever you want.

289
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:02,477
I've already cabled
Internal Affairs.

290
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:07,417
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.

291
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,922
Your superiors want to see you...

292
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,960
...the moment you land.

293
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:27,200
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us.

294
00:37:27,378 --> 00:37:30,211
Captain Danko should remain
incommunicado.

295
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,282
The Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why?

296
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,182
They were the closest thing to family
and they weren't gonna interrogate.

297
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,487
How did you get that piece
through customs?

298
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:46,596
Diplomatic immunity.

299
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:50,825
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.

300
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:54,403
You're not supposed to have
that gun, Danko.

301
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,938
I'll tell you what, though.

302
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,804
Tell me what's going on with Viktor
and you keep the gun.

303
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:02,173
Take it.

304
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,405
Come on, gimme a break
with this shit.

305
00:38:04,582 --> 00:38:08,848
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.

306
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,954
You retire the uniform?

307
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,090
I am now undercover.

308
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:15,088
Undercover?

309
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,620
You look like Gumby.

310
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,127
You're gonna fit right in.

311
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:25,525
For your information, Captain,
I shot one of your Russians.

312
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:29,139
Unfortunately, he's not dead.
He's in intensive care.

313
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,775
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.

314
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,569
How long before this happens?

315
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,907
Is this 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor?

316
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,913
other things first.

317
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,351
Hey, Gumby?

318
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,623
Where do you think you're going?

319
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:50,056
Lighten up. I got it.
Thanks.

320
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:53,458
- What are you doing out of bed?
- He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.

321
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:56,429
- That's cute. Keep an eye on him.
- Why me?

322
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,034
Because I said so.
He's a material witness.

323
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,637
Maybe Donnelly can figure out
what to do.

324
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:04,969
- How come I get all the shit jobs?
- Because it fits you.

325
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,578
- You come with me?
- You heard. I just got my orders.

326
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,011
- Take me to the same hotel?
- Do I look like a cab?

327
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,912
Yes.

328
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,780
I just took him back
to the hotel.

329
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:22,152
He went in,
came out ten minutes later.

330
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,056
I didn't know what to do,
so I brought him here.

331
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:26,594
okay. Good.

332
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:31,932
About your involvement in this,
you know standard procedure.

333
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:36,540
If you're a witness to a murder, you
can't be active in the investigation.

334
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,937
okay, I know.

335
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,874
I'm not taking you off the case.

336
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,412
You and Gallagher were friends.

337
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll fit you in somehow.

338
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,451
Send in Danko.

339
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,620
The two Russian suits
that showed up at the hospital.

340
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,765
They want Danko in a big way.

341
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,696
So I told them we'd put him
on a plane soon.

342
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:10,196
Please be seated, Captain.

343
00:40:10,374 --> 00:40:12,365
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

344
00:40:12,543 --> 00:40:15,011
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.

345
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,808
We met. I'd like to run
this by you, Captain.

346
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:25,711
''Viktor Rosta. Full name,
Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.

347
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,758
Born September 4, 1 944.
Georgia, Russia.

348
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,590
His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the U.S.S.R....

349
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:35,994
for the crime of Brigandage.''

350
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,634
Brigandage?

351
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,896
Burning villages, raping women.

352
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,333
That goes on in Russia?

353
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,602
In past, during war.

354
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,211
Not now.

355
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,906
According to you.
According to this...

356
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,812
Viktor spent three years
in the army and six...

357
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,545
on a forced labor camp
for drug offenses.

358
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,712
''Is currently wanted
in the U.S.S.R.....

359
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,950
for murder, kidnapping, rape...

360
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,891
extortion,
currency speculation...

361
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,293
and drug dealing.''

362
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,934
Where did you get this information?

363
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:15,197
Your boys in Washington have decided
to be cooperative since Viktor split.

364
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,670
In fact, they got
a whole new attitude.

365
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:20,140
I hear they're sending
over some caviar.

366
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,779
Why didn't you tell us
this before?

367
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,815
I had no authorization.

368
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,316
Bullshit!

369
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:33,620
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.

370
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,918
Anything else we should know?

371
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:39,988
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.

372
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:43,929
I need cooperation.

373
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,439
You wanna stick around...

374
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:53,600
and find Viktor, Captain,
that's fine by me.

375
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,577
one more thing.

376
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:01,217
I don't want the press
to get near you.

377
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:04,182
And don't roll through town
like the Red Army!

378
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,827
Have you wigged out?

379
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:16,092
Danko is the perfect weapon,
a loose cannon.

380
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:19,134
If he helps us find Rosta,
great.

381
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:22,795
If he screws up, breaks rules,
he's a Russian.

382
00:42:23,007 --> 00:42:26,340
- But what about Ridzik?
- Ridzik is a good cop.

383
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,775
And a total expert at fucking up.

384
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:34,008
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.

385
00:42:34,451 --> 00:42:36,510
I'm having them bring in
Gallagher's snitch...

386
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,121
the guy who helped us bust
the cleanheads.

387
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:45,853
He's a sleaze, but I think he can tell
us who's brokering the cleanhead's deal.

388
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,496
He visits Viktor in jail?

389
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:49,599
only two folks had that honor:

390
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,827
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and that Russian I shot.

391
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:56,131
The girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.

392
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,275
We're gonna try to catch up
with her later on tonight.

393
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,808
About this pile of shit pimp here.

394
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:05,437
In this country, we try to protect
the rights of individuals.

395
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:09,745
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
you can't even touch his ass.

396
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:13,856
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.

397
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,089
I'm gonna handle this one.

398
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:26,593
Hey, Streak.

399
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:29,466
- You can't hold me here, Dickweed!
- Hostility.

400
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,937
You got nothing on me.
This is bullshit!

401
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,167
- Easy.
- Where is Viktor?

402
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:36,573
What the fuck are you doing?

403
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,272
I don't know who he thinks he is.
I'll have both your badges!

404
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:43,419
Easy, Streak.
Just sit down, relax.

405
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,556
I wanna ask you a couple of questions
about the cleanheads.

406
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:49,351
Fair price for services rendered?

407
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,256
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

408
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:56,661
Cleanheads got a monster deal going
down. I told Gallagher. End of story.

409
00:43:56,834 --> 00:43:58,529
He lies.

410
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,500
In this country, he has
that God-given right.

411
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,009
Do I smell heroin?

412
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:10,146
- What's this?
- Come on, man!

413
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:13,249
-You bring this into the police station?
-You planted that.

414
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,783
That's disrespectful.
This is distribution weight.

415
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:17,045
Fuckin' cop setup!

416
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:19,280
You're fired.

417
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,754
Cleanheads' deal:
who, when and where?

418
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,485
The lawyer I got makes A.C.L.U.
look like Nazis.

419
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,961
He lives for cop misconduct.
Probably sue you for free.

420
00:44:28,132 --> 00:44:30,692
And I ain't tellin' you shit!

421
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,404
Jesus! oh, shit!

422
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,666
Abdul Elijah runs the deal
from Joliet.

423
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,640
Shit's comin' in a couple of days.
I don't know where.

424
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:44,781
I swear on my balls!
I don't know!

425
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,415
Soviet method is more economical.

426
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:58,325
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain an individual's rights.

427
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,492
Sorry about that hand.
You gotta watch these doorjambs.

428
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,501
They're dangerous.

429
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:14,343
Breaking his goddamn fingers in front
of me. You can't pull a stunt like that.

430
00:45:14,511 --> 00:45:16,877
- You ignored me.
- Miranda?

431
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,845
In your country, it's okay
to lie, put drug in pocket?

432
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,645
No, not really.

433
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,950
Maybe I was a little out of line.
I was just trying to get him to talk.

434
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:31,254
- I wasn't gonna prosecute the guy.
- We both go too far.

435
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:35,762
Shit! All I know is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose somewhere...

436
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,595
and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.

437
00:45:38,769 --> 00:45:41,101
It really sucks.

438
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:43,398
Who is Abdul Elijah?

439
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,476
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going now.

440
00:45:47,644 --> 00:45:49,839
- Where can we find him?
- In jail.

441
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,004
Miranda Law is there?

442
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,912
Yes. Miranda is there.

443
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:58,543
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.

444
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:03,182
In Soviet Union, only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.

445
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,123
You're shitting me!

446
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,263
I am not shitting on you.

447
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,729
We go to see Abdul? Yes?

448
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,836
Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.
I'm your escort.

449
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,472
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything?

450
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:20,974
- I think you're safe.
-Just checking.

451
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:24,637
once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.

452
00:46:24,815 --> 00:46:28,342
The Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.

453
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:33,218
Since most convicts are repeaters,
gang leaders got connections to outside.

454
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,255
They're in operation.

455
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,094
Cleanheads' playground.

456
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:48,568
- From now on, you're on your own.
- Thanks.

457
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:52,871
There he is. Abdul Elijah...

458
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,874
sitting on his throne
with his cronies.

459
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,172
He makes them shave their heads
to prove obedience.

460
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,805
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.

461
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:03,646
Kind of like your government, Ivan?

462
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,186
Come here, you.

463
00:47:05,355 --> 00:47:07,789
I wanna talk to you.

464
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:12,327
This Captain Danko. He's come from
Russia to speak to your scoutmaster.

465
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,430
That's nice, but who
the fuck are you?

466
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,625
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.

467
00:47:18,802 --> 00:47:19,826
No shit.

468
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:23,439
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself...

469
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,734
are incarcerated to keep us quiet.

470
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:28,434
What is your political crime?

471
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:30,307
I robbed a bank.

472
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,940
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?

473
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:37,245
I have Viktor's key.

474
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,855
If that's true, then you also
have Viktor's money...

475
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:44,153
and all you need is half a hundred
dollar bill and you and me do business.

476
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:46,819
I give you key,
you give me Viktor.

477
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,462
That is unethical.

478
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,833
You keep cocaine.

479
00:47:55,572 --> 00:48:00,669
Bad. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.

480
00:48:00,844 --> 00:48:03,278
We are not like American police.

481
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:07,884
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up...

482
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,919
and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.

483
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:15,525
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.

484
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,184
Then I settle for your eyes.

485
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:23,322
You can't threaten me,
white boy.

486
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:30,665
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.

487
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:35,073
I'm 38 years old and I've been
locked up 26 of those.

488
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,543
I educated myself in here.

489
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:42,777
I've come to understand this country
was built on exploiting the black man.

490
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:46,354
of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.

491
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:49,253
But your country exploits
its own people just the same.

492
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,260
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here...

493
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,125
right, comrade?

494
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,132
You see, this ain't
just no drug deal.

495
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,668
This is politics, baby.
This is economics.

496
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,828
This is spiritual.

497
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,304
I plan to sell drugs...

498
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:08,000
to every white man
in the world...

499
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,914
and his sister.

500
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,912
I still want Rosta.

501
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,487
- Yeah, real bad. I can tell.
- Where can I find him?

502
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,420
I tell you what I am gonna do,
Captain.

503
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:28,927
I am gonna put you two white boys
together, see if you can't work it out.

504
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,532
I need Viktor.

505
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,565
He needs that key.

506
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,270
And you...

507
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:40,206
you're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.

508
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,772
Be cool.

509
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,622
okay, so tell me.
How did it go?

510
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,957
- Fine.
- Fine?

511
00:50:02,132 --> 00:50:03,656
You wanna cut the shit?

512
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:07,633
You were talking to that jazzbo so long,
I thought about having my head shaved.

513
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:10,937
It could be a good idea.

514
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,109
- What's that?
- My watch.

515
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,941
- It's on Moscow time.
- Time to pick up Pokey?

516
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:21,084
- Time to feed parakeet.
- What's that?

517
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:23,479
Russian for jerking off?

518
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,022
- I guess not.
- What's wrong with parakeet?

519
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,717
Nothing. I didn't say anything
was wrong with parakeet.

520
00:50:31,928 --> 00:50:34,226
My kid sister used to have one.

521
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,958
You want a parakeet, it's okay
with me. I don't give a shit.

522
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:38,998
You think that parakeet is feminine?

523
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:42,900
Did I say that?
I didn't say that, did I?

524
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:45,598
What do I know?
I guess it's okay.

525
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,073
- Christ, it's fine.
- Thank you.

526
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,678
You're welcome.

527
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,381
Slow and fast.

528
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,916
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, hips.

529
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,778
Easy.

530
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,725
one, two, smooth.

531
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:23,576
Mind showing me I.D.?
I like to know who I'm talking to.

532
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,305
Ridzik, Arthur.
Detective Sergeant.

533
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,313
This is Captain Danko.
He's from Moscow.

534
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,816
You went to see Rosta in jail.

535
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,545
- What did you talk about?
- The weather...

536
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,020
taxes, inflation.

537
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,251
Did you meet him hanging around
the hotel bar, lobby?

538
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:40,020
Fuck you.

539
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,494
No. I have a headache
and good taste.

540
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:44,724
I don't have to listen.

541
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:50,870
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.

542
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,043
Shit.

543
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,180
It's really no big deal.

544
00:51:58,348 --> 00:52:02,045
He told me to go to The Garvin, get
his old room, where exactly to look.

545
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,552
It was just a passport and this
hundred-dollar bill torn in half.

546
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:09,158
I gave it to a friend of Viktor's.
I don't even know his name.

547
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:12,295
Cut the shit!
Just tell me where he's at.

548
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,292
I don't know.

549
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:14,521
- You got a phone number?
- I lost it.

550
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:18,725
- Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.
- Really?

551
00:52:18,902 --> 00:52:21,894
- A cop died because of him.
- I don't know.

552
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:26,372
You know anything about 1 1 th and State?
I'll take you and book you for murder.

553
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:29,876
- Trying to scare me?
- Wondering why you're helping Viktor.

554
00:52:30,046 --> 00:52:31,877
He's my husband.

555
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:39,446
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.

556
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,855
Wait. We can use her
to find Viktor.

557
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,656
You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll go home and whack off.

558
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,165
Watch Crime Stories.

559
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,907
Viktor uses fake name,
marries American to get visa to U.S.

560
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:01,669
Right. Why do I get the feeling
you're taking it so personal?

561
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,712
I shot his brother
six months ago in Moscow.

562
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:06,644
- Shot him dead?
- Yes.

563
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,341
- Way to go.
- Thank you.

564
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,465
Why don't we stake it out?
You go to the car.

565
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:28,934
I'll get something to eat. I'll get you
something healthy from all food groups:

566
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:31,437
hamburger, french fries,
coffee, donuts.

567
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,599
- Wait.
- You don't like onions?

568
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:36,575
- Give me key to car.
- It's unlocked.

569
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:38,304
In case she leave.

570
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,008
No, you can't drive that car.
What if you crash?

571
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,745
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.

572
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,117
Key.

573
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,987
All right. But honk
if you see something.

574
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:26,521
Hey, asshole.
You can't park here.

575
00:54:26,696 --> 00:54:29,221
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.

576
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:31,924
So move or give me 50 bucks.

577
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:35,503
- I do not understand.
- Let me make it simple, moron.

578
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:39,335
You move your ass or gimme 50
or I take my bat...

579
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,306
and mutilate your car.

580
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,504
- Do you know Miranda?
- Never heard of the bitch.

581
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:12,139
- Everything okay.
- Yes, fine. No problems.

582
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,903
What about that sack of shit
laying on the sidewalk?

583
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,909
He lives here.

584
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,648
You're a real beaut.

585
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,910
I called the squad room.
Guess what?

586
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:25,452
Tatomovich, that bastard I shot?

587
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:27,852
He's coming out of his coma.

588
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,152
Why don't we just go
and interrogate him and bag this?

589
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,921
Here she is.

590
00:55:46,142 --> 00:55:48,007
- Now we go.
- Wait, wait!

591
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:52,205
Shit! Goddamn it!Jesus Christ!
I just burned off my dick!

592
00:55:52,382 --> 00:55:55,010
oh, God!Jesus!

593
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,780
Look at the mess I made.
Now I gotta wash the car.

594
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:02,288
Just wrecked my goddamn suit
and I hard-boiled my nuts.

595
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,394
It's gonna look like I pissed
in my pants all night.

596
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:07,052
Careful with the driving.

597
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,925
I don't want any accidents.

598
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,693
I'll have to
fill out paperwork forever.

599
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,893
I have car under control.

600
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:17,699
Yeah, sure. I suppose they taught
you everything you need to know...

601
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,901
about car wrecks and the price
of insurance in your school in Kiev.

602
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:26,441
In Socialist countries,
insurance not necessary.

603
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:28,447
State pays for everything.

604
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,781
Yeah. Well, tell me something.

605
00:56:31,955 --> 00:56:33,718
If it's such a paradise...

606
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,723
how come you have as much trouble
with heroin and cocaine?

607
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,418
Chinese find way.

608
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,689
Right after revolution...

609
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:45,357
line up all drug dealers,
addicts...

610
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,834
take them to public square
and shoot them in the back of the head.

611
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:52,998
It would never work here.
Politicians wouldn't go for it.

612
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:55,110
Shoot them first.

613
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:03,916
Christ! They're behind us.

614
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,022
That's the general idea.

615
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:50,691
Look at this. We have a pro basketball
team heading towards us with guns.

616
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,832
- Hold this.
- What's this?

617
00:57:57,006 --> 00:57:59,236
It's Viktor's key.

618
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:03,535
- Put gun away.
- Are you nuts?

619
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:25,564
I'm supposed to tell you that
this is a truce arranged by Abdul.

620
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,101
- You leave your guns with those guys.
- No way.

621
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,865
Chicago cop never relinquishes
his weapon.

622
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,541
Here.

623
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:40,776
You got the key?

624
00:58:41,885 --> 00:58:43,978
I'm glad we hid that key.

625
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,180
Good thing we didn't bring it.
We'd really be in deep shit.

626
00:58:51,494 --> 00:58:52,927
Don't waste your time.

627
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,156
- Where is Viktor?
- We got everything under control.

628
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,460
Well, good.
I'll be the translator.

629
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,502
You got a job.
You're the hostage.

630
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,573
I'm out of here. I've had enough
of this macho shit.

631
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:07,039
Thank you for your help.

632
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,906
I'm sorry, but this is way past me.

633
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,240
Honey, I understand, really.

634
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:16,713
Go see Viktor.

635
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,855
He's down that ramp over there.
You get out of hand...

636
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:23,992
your friend here
gonna be gone.

637
00:59:24,193 --> 00:59:25,990
Hear that?

638
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,559
Prick.

639
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:56,525
Greetings, Comrade.
We meet in strange places.

640
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:09,263
I don't like being used as bait.
I though Viktor wanted to see me.

641
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:11,498
Viktor wants you to get in car.

642
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:28,787
If they'd let me have my gun
you would be already dead.

643
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,585
Cigarette?

644
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,698
The people have many needs.

645
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:45,500
one is law and order,
other, entertainment.

646
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,335
We both have our codes.

647
01:00:50,513 --> 01:00:53,243
Yours, one of the state.

648
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,278
Mine...

649
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:56,918
one of thieves.

650
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,848
We both respect courage.

651
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:05,051
We even hold our own lives
in contempt.

652
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:08,720
You have contempt for all life.

653
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:12,198
You don't, huh?

654
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,461
You killed my friend.

655
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:18,741
You killed my brother.

656
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,069
Your brother was criminal.

657
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:26,545
A dead man is a dead man.

658
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:30,152
After 7 0 years, the doors
begin to open in Moskva.

659
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:34,312
our first taste of freedom
will be cut with cocaine.

660
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,617
Any country
that can survive Stalin...

661
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:39,227
can certainly handle
a little dope.

662
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,855
I think you should come off
your high horse, Captain...

663
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,593
and start to talk business.

664
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:50,665
You have my key.

665
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,400
I need it quite badly.

666
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:55,635
I'm willing to pay
for it generously.

667
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:58,610
More than you can make
in ten years.

668
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:00,772
I do not sell drugs.

669
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,750
Foolish.

670
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:11,621
You are so foolish.

671
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:19,259
I thought you might
be more reasonable.

672
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:21,562
Money has a way
of doing that to a man.

673
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,603
But no.

674
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:25,832
I don't think so.

675
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,339
Not with you.

676
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:30,603
You are one of those
kind of Soviets...

677
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,873
that only look
forward to death.

678
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,485
I know you well.

679
01:02:37,653 --> 01:02:42,613
Without me,
you don't even exist.

680
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:01,735
I don't give a shit if they did
give us the fuckin' guns back!

681
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:05,039
These are the motherfuckers
that killed Gallagher.

682
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:07,239
And you call yourself
a fuckin' cop!

683
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:10,908
In this country,
we trust our partners.

684
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,954
We don't hold back
from our partners...

685
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,058
and we never leave
our partners...

686
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:19,786
holding their dicks
in their hands...

687
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,420
while some bald motherfucker's
got a gun in his ear!

688
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:28,100
Here! Take this goddamned key.
Take it!

689
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:32,207
Now we go to hospital
to question Tatomovich.

690
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,605
You are a shithead!

691
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:41,774
- We're here to see Tatomovich.
- I got him right over here.

692
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:44,283
This is not part of our deal.
I thought--

693
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,991
What is his condition?

694
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:29,757
He started coming around about an hour
ago, mumbling something in Russian.

695
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:32,162
They got a nurse
in there with him.

696
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,230
- Any visitors from downtown?
- Not so far, but they're on the way.

697
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,567
You'd better wait
for Stobbs and Donnelly.

698
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:42,176
- Ernie, let's get some coffee.
- Sure, okay.

699
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:47,809
Pardon me.

700
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:53,282
Check it out. I knew
I should have been a doctor.

701
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:57,089
This area's restrict--

702
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,759
Hey, buddy. Hey, shithead!

703
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:05,263
You talk to him.
You speak his language.

704
01:05:08,771 --> 01:05:10,830
Come on, scumbag.
Don't play dead.

705
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:19,774
The nurse.

706
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:07,351
Move!

707
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,329
Shit! Look out!

708
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:16,371
Goddamn it, lady, police!
Stop or I'll shoot.

709
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:18,938
- Don't! Put it down!
- What are you doing here?

710
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:22,077
- Put it down! Are you crazy?
- Move, goddamn it!

711
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,350
Don't! Stop it!

712
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,621
You--

713
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,466
Ah, what the hell?
It was a guy.

714
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:38,175
Shit!

715
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:45,416
- You are stupid.
- I never meant for any of this--

716
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:50,190
Viktor has ten women like you at home.
They're all dead or in prison.

717
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:55,199
What am I supposed to do?

718
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,033
Go!

719
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,919
I just don't see how she could
disappear into thin air.

720
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,754
You checked the back stairs?

721
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:20,987
No sign of her?

722
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:22,994
She just got away?

723
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:28,296
- Nice work, Gumby.
- Thank you.

724
01:08:28,471 --> 01:08:30,803
- I didn't mean that.
- oh.

725
01:08:30,973 --> 01:08:32,907
You got a shithouse in Russia?

726
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:35,635
We got one here and you and
I are standing right in it.

727
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,076
It's not only gonna hit the fan,
it's gonna go right through the ceiling.

728
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:42,342
Watch it, lady, okay? I don't know
why you insisted on this tetanus shot.

729
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,282
I had one 14 years ago.
Easy!

730
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,217
I ought to shoot that bitch.

731
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,223
What's in that, cement?

732
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,623
All right, what's the score?

733
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:59,632
Shit, it's been
a hell of a night.

734
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:04,136
First, some cleanhead stuck
his damn gun in my ear...

735
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:08,242
- and Danko here shot a drag queen.
- I've always enjoyed your reports.

736
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:11,402
I'm especially going to enjoy when
you detail your cross examination...

737
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,411
- of Gallagher's informant.
- Streak?

738
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,482
According to his lawyer,
you tried to break his hand.

739
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:19,246
He's now filing a criminal and
civil suit against the department.

740
01:09:19,421 --> 01:09:21,981
Well, it's bullshit.
We can beat that rap.

741
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,956
He got his hand stuck in a door.
Danko will tell you.

742
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:28,858
After silencing the alarm button
on the E.K.G. monitor...

743
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:32,262
el transvesto killed Tatomovich by
shooting an air bubble into a vein.

744
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,265
He obviously didn't
want us to question him.

745
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,870
Viktor did not want
me to question him.

746
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,871
The drag queen
belongs to Viktor?

747
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,975
Yes. He killed his own man.

748
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:44,306
He knew I would get
information from Tatomovich.

749
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,847
- He thinks it's better to kill him.
- Did you get to his wife?

750
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:50,884
The Manzetti woman? We've been
trying to track her down all night.

751
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,320
No, we don't have shit.

752
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:06,195
Tell me, Captain. Where did
you get the gun you used?

753
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:10,031
Registered in my name.
Moscow Militia Headquarters.

754
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:15,971
He did not know about gun.

755
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:18,511
Under the circumstances, I'm going
to have to ask for your weapon.

756
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,615
And I say, no.

757
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,910
I see Ridzik is teaching you
his sense of humor.

758
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:27,351
Your gun, Captain! Now!
Don't fuck with me!

759
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:51,672
Sergeant, I need to see paperwork on
this incident by 1 0:00 this morning.

760
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:53,838
Every move you
and Danko have made.

761
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,382
You'll have it.

762
01:10:56,552 --> 01:10:59,612
- Where did you put the witnesses?
- Right down the hall.

763
01:11:01,123 --> 01:11:03,023
I need other gun.

764
01:11:03,192 --> 01:11:05,922
Just get away from me.
I can't deal with that.

765
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:08,928
We got no leads, pal.
We're battin' fuckin' zero.

766
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:12,295
Don't look at me like that.
It's not happenin'.

767
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:15,995
I give you a gun, my ass
is grass. You understand?

768
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:19,504
Donnelly wants me for dog meat,
so forget it.

769
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:21,700
Just get in the car and relax.

770
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:31,047
We have many men like
Commander Donnelly in Soviet Union.

771
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,384
I understand him.
He's like K.G.B.

772
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,126
All right, goddamn it.

773
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,068
All right, I owe you one
'cause you saved my life tonight.

774
01:11:49,204 --> 01:11:50,831
Here.

775
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:56,177
You are now the proud owner of
the most powerful handgun in the world.

776
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,440
Soviet Podbyrin 9.2 millimeter...

777
01:12:00,616 --> 01:12:02,777
is world's most powerful handgun.

778
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,785
Everyone knows the Magnum .44
is the big boy on the block.

779
01:12:06,955 --> 01:12:09,480
Why do you think
Dirty Harry uses it?

780
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,362
Who is Dirty Harry?

781
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,631
You got your site report,
preliminary report...

782
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:27,606
accident report, a questionnaire
from the coroner to fill out...

783
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,040
which has to be typed
in triplicate.

784
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:33,306
- How are you two fellows doing?
- Great.Just got my ass jammed...

785
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:36,178
- with a horse needle.
- Poor baby.

786
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,378
Look, lady, I just got
my coffee the perfect color.

787
01:12:39,555 --> 01:12:41,546
It's the only thing I got
going for me tonight.

788
01:12:43,792 --> 01:12:45,623
You married?

789
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:49,923
I'm just curious. I mean,
we are working together.

790
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,731
Ever?

791
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:56,768
You got a girlfriend?

792
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,663
Ever?

793
01:12:58,841 --> 01:13:00,331
of course.

794
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:03,602
Great. That's good to hear.

795
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:07,006
How about your dad?
Was he a cop?

796
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:12,921
Army. Dead 1 1 years.

797
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:16,921
How about your ma?

798
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:19,959
Nurse. Died when I was young.

799
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,495
Grandparents?

800
01:13:22,664 --> 01:13:24,757
Killed in war against Nazis.

801
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:28,567
Pretty fuckin' grim.

802
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,932
You got any brothers
or sisters?

803
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,501
You?

804
01:13:36,678 --> 01:13:38,908
I got one sister.
Divorced.

805
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,174
Parents are both dead.

806
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,581
My dad was a cop.
A real good cop.

807
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,518
I guess you and I won't spend a lot of
time Christmas shopping this year, huh?

808
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:52,689
You don't like talking
about this stuff, do ya?

809
01:13:53,862 --> 01:13:55,693
I didn't think so.

810
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,098
Yo, sweet cheeks!
While we're young, huh?

811
01:14:04,773 --> 01:14:06,206
Tea, please.

812
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:09,344
Uh, in a glass with lemon.

813
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:11,935
Right?

814
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:17,181
I saw Dr. Zhivago.

815
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,903
I'm gonna go back to the station house.
You catch some Z's and take a shower.

816
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,803
We'll get back to it
in a couple hours.

817
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:51,349
Hey, you're all wet.

818
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,509
Messages.

819
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,384
Just tryin' to be friendly.

820
01:14:57,593 --> 01:15:00,323
You got a whole mess of them here.
All from the same honey too.

821
01:15:00,529 --> 01:15:02,963
Been callin' every ten minutes
the last hour.

822
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
Hey, buddy, I got an idea:
Why don't you just use my phone?

823
01:15:10,672 --> 01:15:12,469
Just make sure it's a local.

824
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:19,811
This is Danko.

825
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:22,575
Look, I can't be
in the middle of this.

826
01:15:22,784 --> 01:15:25,878
If Viktor finds out, you gotta
promise you'll protect me.

827
01:15:26,088 --> 01:15:29,421
The drugs are coming in tonight.
I give you Viktor,you let me walk.

828
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:33,621
- I do not understand.
- You know exactly what I mean.

829
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,389
You get Viktor, I go free.
You understand ''freedom''?

830
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,794
Look, I just want my life back.

831
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:42,470
The city pays me $5.84 an hour to teach
kids to dance they hope won't...

832
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,105
turn into junkies, Viktor gives
me ten grand just to marry him.

833
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,435
You figure it out.

834
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,508
He's gonna contact me.

835
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,578
I find out when and where this big
drug deals going down. I tell you guys.

836
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,773
- Why would he tell you?
- He trusts me. I'm his wife.

837
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,521
Come on, Danko.
Don't just breathe at me.

838
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:05,957
I get Viktor, I promise
I do what I can to help.

839
01:16:35,357 --> 01:16:38,224
- What's buggin' you?
- What do you think?

840
01:16:38,393 --> 01:16:40,884
Check your messages.
Your phone's been driving me crazy.

841
01:16:49,171 --> 01:16:51,401
Ridzik, Nelligan here.

842
01:16:51,573 --> 01:16:54,269
That 560 report--
please get it done tonight.

843
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,411
It's got to be in by morning.

844
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,376
Yo, Art, this is pat,
your millionaire brother-in-law.

845
01:16:59,548 --> 01:17:01,982
Yo.! Hey.!
pay attention to me.

846
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:04,677
This alimony business with your
sister is getting out ofhand.

847
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,548
We gotta talk. I'll be at
the key shop later tonight.

848
01:18:03,512 --> 01:18:05,241
Hi, guys.

849
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,184
How you doin'?

850
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:15,647
Hey, you want
your old room back?

851
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:14,515
We're ready for our next case.
please introduce our new couple.

852
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:17,345
Your honor, this is the case
of Antonello versus Antonello.

853
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,420
Ben Antonello is a
2 7-year-old police officer.

854
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,682
Roxanne Antonello is 23
and works at--

855
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:54,287
- You shop full-time, then ?
- As a matter of fact, I do.!

856
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:01,359
Where is he?

857
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,226
He's in the bathroom.

858
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,914
Wrong guy.

859
01:20:25,821 --> 01:20:27,618
Viktor set us up!

860
01:20:45,207 --> 01:20:46,834
It's him!

861
01:21:44,266 --> 01:21:49,363
No. Not me. I'm not with them.
I don't know anything about this shit!

862
01:21:49,537 --> 01:21:51,903
- I just wanna get out of here.
- How many more?

863
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:53,904
I don't know.
They just killed my trick.

864
01:21:55,076 --> 01:21:57,806
I don't know anything about this!

865
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,850
Hey, wait a minute!

866
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,424
I don't believe this.
What is this all about?

867
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:21,596
Where are you going?

868
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:26,106
You're not gonna start
shooting again, are you?

869
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:31,979
What's in there?

870
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:42,816
What are you gonna do?
Let's get outta here! oh, God!

871
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:26,490
Don't get any on your shoes.

872
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:29,636
Would you tell me
who's gonna explain this to my boss?

873
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:33,274
It looks like Beirut.
He's gonna be pissed.

874
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:36,444
Who's gonna back me up when I tell him
it's not my fault?

875
01:23:36,644 --> 01:23:38,874
The city of Chicago?
You cops?

876
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:44,211
Somebody's gotta pay for this and it
ain't gonna be that Commie bastard!

877
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:48,515
I don't know!
I don't know about anything!

878
01:23:48,723 --> 01:23:51,920
- Everybody just started shooting.
- Where'd you get the gun?

879
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:53,958
In my purse.

880
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,029
I don't know nothing
about any of this.

881
01:23:57,232 --> 01:24:01,100
- You carry a gun?
- Around here everybody does.

882
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:03,099
You meet a lot of weirdos.

883
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:08,801
- How many more upstairs?
- Three.

884
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:12,174
There's only one thing clear to me.

885
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:15,145
That Russian bastard
is still holding out on us.

886
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:19,343
Young woman found in the Chicago River
tonight is Catherine ''Cat''Manzetti.

887
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:23,958
The victim was a dance instructor
employed at Wicker park Center.

888
01:24:24,125 --> 01:24:25,956
She was 2 4 years old.

889
01:24:26,127 --> 01:24:30,257
The body was discovered beneath
Kinsey Bridge by a local patrol unit.

890
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:34,766
The cause of death is not known,
but foul play has not been ruled out.

891
01:24:34,936 --> 01:24:38,497
Thus far, investigators are refusing
to comment on the incident.

892
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:41,972
Miss Manzetti was identified
by police records.

893
01:24:42,143 --> 01:24:44,304
In 1 986, she was charged--

894
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,610
It's Viktor's wife.

895
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:52,985
Cat Manzetti. We fished her out
of the river an hour ago.

896
01:24:53,154 --> 01:24:58,456
Preliminary med-path indicates a broken
neck or strangulation in the works.

897
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:02,186
I want an autopsy right away.

898
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,327
If I talk to them,
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

899
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,802
Bring them both in,
shut them down, the end.

900
01:25:11,973 --> 01:25:15,465
Interview Danko in my office later.
I want some debriefing.

901
01:25:15,643 --> 01:25:18,476
I was very wrong about the downside.

902
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:28,013
Donnelly says you're riding
the desk starting now.

903
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:31,920
We're sending you back
behind the curtain where you belong.

904
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:35,889
Eat shit.

905
01:25:36,831 --> 01:25:38,423
Excuse me?

906
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,425
See you at the office.

907
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:52,436
Stupid, goddamn, fucking Russians!

908
01:25:53,715 --> 01:25:56,582
Don't take that personal.
I didn't mean you.

909
01:25:56,751 --> 01:26:01,051
I mean Viktor. Except Viktor's
not stupid because he's got the key.

910
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:13,800
Art, if you and your foreign friend
step back here, we can talk.

911
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:15,299
These the books?

912
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,667
Alphabetical order.
They're in English. Is that a problem?

913
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,206
- Take a walk, will you?
- What did you do?

914
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:24,174
Lock one of your girlfriends
in the patrol car?

915
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:29,080
- Tell your sister to stop calling me.
- I'll give you a tip.

916
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:31,980
Pay your alimony on time
and she'll leave you alone.

917
01:26:32,153 --> 01:26:35,213
Said it was your idea
to go back to court.

918
01:26:35,390 --> 01:26:38,655
I don't have any more money.
We both agreed to the payments.

919
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:43,024
Your May check arrived July 9
and bounced like a ball.

920
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,895
- Too much free work for the police.
- Maybe we should have a pity party.

921
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:54,003
I offered her money not to marry you.

922
01:26:54,175 --> 01:26:56,439
I gave her six great months.

923
01:26:56,611 --> 01:26:58,875
You know what you are?
You're cheap.

924
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,811
You hurt her. You owe her money,
and you should pay up.

925
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:05,475
- You're a sleazebag!
- Get out of my face!

926
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,460
Find anything?

927
01:27:52,967 --> 01:27:54,491
Thank you.

928
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:18,591
Everything okay, yes?

929
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,920
Sure.

930
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:26,794
The stuff s coming in on the 9:30
from El Paso. Check it out.

931
01:28:29,003 --> 01:28:30,197
I trust you.

932
01:28:30,371 --> 01:28:32,703
Spread it all over Siberia?

933
01:28:51,025 --> 01:28:52,686
All right.

934
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:56,489
Let's go in. Wait a minute.
Now, look.

935
01:28:56,664 --> 01:29:00,566
I know you really want this guy,
but this is a Chicago Police matter.

936
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:04,899
Go in the front. Get to the rear.
I got the back. Don't try to be a hero.

937
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,540
You dig?

938
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:12,571
You understand? Dig?
Didn't learn that in Kiev?

939
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:15,773
- I'm not on holiday here.
- Then let's go.

940
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:39,099
Excuse me.

941
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:43,209
You got change
for a $1 00 bill?

942
01:29:47,582 --> 01:29:49,846
This is the smallest I have.

943
01:29:58,025 --> 01:30:00,994
Your merchandise
is in the luggage trunks.

944
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,512
Hey!

945
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:39,229
You did not make it, Viktor.

946
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,001
Back off, Captain.

947
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:46,038
He killed a Chicago cop.
Chicago gets him first.

948
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,174
I have my orders!

949
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,003
Are you nuts?

950
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:52,672
All right.

951
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,646
Get real. Look, we're doing
good things here. Move!

952
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:43,092
- I'm not leaving yet, mister.
- Get out!

953
01:31:45,399 --> 01:31:46,832
Hey!

954
01:31:54,141 --> 01:31:57,076
- Get in.
- Were you gonna leave me here?

955
01:32:03,217 --> 01:32:06,880
- Where did you learn to drive a bus?
- Kiev.

956
01:32:07,054 --> 01:32:08,885
- In the army.
-Jesus!

957
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,287
We're going against traffic.
Get on the other side!

958
01:32:14,929 --> 01:32:17,193
You're not listening to me!

959
01:32:18,432 --> 01:32:19,228
Christ!

960
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,429
Right!

961
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:31,241
Way to go! That was
a fucking Chicago landmark!

962
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:57,499
Where are all the cops?
They're never around when you need them.

963
01:32:57,672 --> 01:33:01,733
You make a U-turn, they ticket you.
Where the fuck are they?

964
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:17,183
Watch it!

965
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,098
Shit!

966
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:30,722
Shit! We call this ''Chicken.''
only we don't play it with buses!

967
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:33,492
- This is no game!
- No shit!

968
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:38,301
Get ready to swerve!

969
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:41,741
Get ready to swerve!

970
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:49,175
You crazy fucker!

971
01:35:32,393 --> 01:35:35,021
You fucker! You almost killed
both of us, goddamn it!

972
01:35:35,196 --> 01:35:38,256
- And Viktor!
- Fuck Viktor!

973
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:42,300
Are you crazy?
You almost got us both killed!

974
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:45,803
Jesus Christ, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

975
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:49,002
You son of a bitch!

976
01:35:57,518 --> 01:35:59,509
I take care of this.

977
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:08,961
I give up.
This whole thing's very Russia.

978
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:14,031
Hey, Gumby.

979
01:36:14,201 --> 01:36:16,101
Honk if you need me.

980
01:37:02,883 --> 01:37:04,908
Did you get him?

981
01:37:07,755 --> 01:37:10,451
Nice grouping of your shots.

982
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:12,785
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

983
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,793
I still like Soviet model better.

984
01:37:19,967 --> 01:37:22,162
Got a real attitude problem.

985
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,273
High, left center.

986
01:38:02,142 --> 01:38:04,610
I do not understand this sport.

987
01:38:04,812 --> 01:38:07,542
You're not supposed to.
It's totally American.

988
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:10,206
You should stick to things
you're good at.

989
01:38:10,417 --> 01:38:15,081
Like knee dancing, training those
cute little bears for the circus.

990
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:19,719
- We play baseball in Soviet Union.
- Come on.

991
01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:23,295
Gimme a break, will you?
You haven't got a shot.

992
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:25,898
This is our national pastime.

993
01:38:26,033 --> 01:38:27,864
Forget it.

994
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,197
It'd be a hell of a World Series.

995
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,673
We will win.

996
01:38:39,346 --> 01:38:42,406
Danko, I want to ask you something.

997
01:38:42,616 --> 01:38:46,347
Remember back at the bus station,
both of us had Viktor?

998
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,580
You turned and pointed
the gun at me.

999
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:51,951
You weren't gonna shoot me, right?

1000
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:59,922
Yeah, that's what I figured.

1001
01:39:00,134 --> 01:39:01,965
Just checking.

1002
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:11,235
It is custom in Soviet Union...

1003
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:15,006
to exchange article
as souvenir for friendship.

1004
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:19,284
I decide to give you this.

1005
01:39:21,121 --> 01:39:22,850
That's really nice.

1006
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:26,083
Here. I want you
to have my watch.

1007
01:39:26,293 --> 01:39:31,196
This here is a $1 000 marvel
of Western technology.

1008
01:39:31,365 --> 01:39:33,856
I got it at a discount
from my cousin.

1009
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:37,938
Thanks.

1010
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:39,935
This is really...

1011
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:43,867
a $20 East German watch.

1012
01:39:48,015 --> 01:39:49,642
Thank you.

1013
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,257
We are police officers...

1014
01:39:58,425 --> 01:40:00,086
not politicians.

1015
01:40:00,294 --> 01:40:03,058
It's okay to like each other.

1016
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:15,704
Sorry. My Russian's a little rusty.

1017
01:40:17,444 --> 01:40:18,911
Good luck.

1018
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:21,747
Farewell.

1019
01:40:35,263 --> 01:40:39,111
With My Pleasure
