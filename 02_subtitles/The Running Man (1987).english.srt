1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,754
Yankee nine-niner,
what are your coordinates?

2
00:01:36,798 --> 00:01:38,176
0-2-0.
Flight level 1-5.

3
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:40,430
Above release point
echo bravo one.

4
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:42,560
Move in
and check it out.

5
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,107
Roger.
Moving in.

6
00:01:52,456 --> 00:01:54,001
Food riot in progress.

7
00:01:55,212 --> 00:01:56,966
Approximately
1500 civilians.

8
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,552
No weapons evident.

9
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:00,348
Proceed with plan alpha.

10
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:01,976
Eliminate anything moving.

11
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:03,730
The crowd is unarmed.

12
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,776
There are lots
of women and children.

13
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,949
All they want is food!

14
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,246
Proceed with plan alpha.
All rioters must be eliminated.

15
00:02:13,668 --> 00:02:14,962
The hell with you!

16
00:02:15,254 --> 00:02:16,883
I will not fire
on helpless people.

17
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:20,641
Abort mission.
Return back to base.

18
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,562
Lieutenant Saunders,
take command.

19
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:24,357
Detain Richards.
Proceed as ordered.

20
00:02:26,403 --> 00:02:27,865
Richards,
what are you doing?

21
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:32,249
AAah!

22
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,765
Damn it!

23
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,270
We're pitching over!

24
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:42,980
Ah!

25
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:44,984
I got it.
I got control.

26
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,492
He said detain him.
Don't drop him.

27
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,791
Ah!

28
00:02:55,966 --> 00:02:57,970
Richards, you're
going to fry for this.

29
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,144
I'll see you
in hell.

30
00:03:15,382 --> 00:03:17,053
Come on, keep digging.

31
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,934
What's the holdup?

32
00:03:20,184 --> 00:03:21,813
This one's had it.

33
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,775
Watch the detonator.

34
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:28,368
Get that garbage
out of here.

35
00:03:29,412 --> 00:03:30,957
Move!

36
00:04:32,463 --> 00:04:34,342
Did you see
The Running Man
last night?

37
00:04:35,887 --> 00:04:37,599
I never miss it.
I won 500 bucks.

38
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,318
Work crew
coming through.

39
00:04:42,777 --> 00:04:44,447
Prisoner transfer
to post.

40
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:46,827
Ok, hang on.

41
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,040
Lenny, this is perimeter.

42
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,253
Shut down
the deadline.

43
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:53,174
Affirmative.
shutting down now.

44
00:04:56,306 --> 00:04:57,976
Access code pending.

45
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,523
Verify perimeter
deactivated.

46
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,529
Sonic deadline is down.

47
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:06,202
OK, move it.
Move it.

48
00:05:06,828 --> 00:05:07,997
Let's go, let's go.

49
00:05:08,248 --> 00:05:10,503
Get out the lead
or lose your head.

50
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:29,209
East perimeter here.
New prisoners are
all in compound.

51
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:34,512
We're clear.

52
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,307
Affirmative.
Activating deadline.

53
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:38,103
What are you
looking at?

54
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:39,564
Get out of here!

55
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:41,402
Sonic deadline is up.
Sonic deadline is up.

56
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,784
Prisoner restraint
Collars armed.

57
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:46,955
Prisoner restraint
Collars armed.

58
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,862
Yeah!
Yeah!

59
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,614
Give you a lift?

60
00:06:29,546 --> 00:06:31,341
Get it open!

61
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:33,262
Repeat the codes.

62
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:35,392
I did. 653.

63
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:38,189
It's not working!

64
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:42,239
You're hell
of an actor, Laughlin.

65
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:43,910
Who was acting?

66
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,872
You're still alive,
aren't you?

67
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:51,008
Repeat that code.

68
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,814
Weiss, what's
the holdup?
Come on!

69
00:06:58,733 --> 00:07:00,069
The linking computer
is denying the code.

70
00:07:03,326 --> 00:07:05,330
Must be the walls in here
are blocking the signal.

71
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:08,211
We try it outside.

72
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:19,318
Let's go! come on!

73
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,947
Get out of the way!

74
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,828
Open the gates!

75
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:31,093
Go ahead, do it.

76
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:33,139
Shut off the deadline,
or we all lose our heads.

77
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,290
The system's blocked.
Must be a lock-out.

78
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,048
Damn!

79
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,013
Perimeter deactivated.
Perimeter deactivated.

80
00:07:54,852 --> 00:07:56,439
All right!
All right!

81
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,028
Chico! Amigo!

82
00:08:00,782 --> 00:08:02,327
Chico! Come back!

83
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,540
The deadline's still up.

84
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,671
He's not going
to make it.

85
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,135
That collar's
going to blow.

86
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:12,056
Chico!

87
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:27,756
Sonic deadline.
Sonic deadline.

88
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,512
Prisoner restraint collars
armed.

89
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,267
Prisoner restraint collars
armed.

90
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,480
Perimeter deactivated.

91
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:37,819
Perimeter deactivated.

92
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:39,948
Perimeter deactivated.

93
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,203
Perimeter deactivated.

94
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,416
Perimeter deactivated.

95
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,418
Zone passes are required
at all times.

96
00:09:25,712 --> 00:09:27,049
Display passes properly.

97
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,387
All interzone workers
with day passes

98
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:31,224
are reminded that curfew
begins at midnight.

99
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,481
Anyone without a valid
zone card after midnight

100
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,989
will be permanently detained.

101
00:09:38,406 --> 00:09:39,366
Cadre kids,

102
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:41,413
Don't forget October is
bonus recruitment month.

103
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,335
Earn a double bonus
for reporting a family member.

104
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,759
ICS, your entertainment
and information network,

105
00:09:48,803 --> 00:09:50,640
reminds you,
seeing is believing.

106
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,565
What's the number one
television show

107
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:58,282
in the whole wide world?

108
00:09:59,242 --> 00:10:00,662
The Running Man!

109
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:01,873
Yes!

110
00:10:02,165 --> 00:10:03,585
Yes, it's The Running Man.

111
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,589
400 square blocks of Danger,
destruction...

112
00:10:07,217 --> 00:10:07,510
Psst!

113
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,180
You want to buy
a hot stereo?

114
00:10:11,142 --> 00:10:11,644
Stevie.

115
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,314
Glad you guys
made it.

116
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:15,318
...unstoppable
network stalkers

117
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:17,656
give criminals, traitors,
and enemies of the state

118
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,746
exactly what they deserve.

119
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:22,959
Sundays, 8:00 to 11:00
on ICS channel 1.

120
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:25,966
Produced in cooperation
with the Department of Justice,

All rights reserved.

122
00:10:28,596 --> 00:10:30,475
The Running Man,
America's favorite game show.

123
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:37,532
A child, your child-

124
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,497
happy, loving, caring...

125
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:42,334
do you
believe this?

126
00:10:42,918 --> 00:10:44,380
24 hours a day.

127
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:46,175
Seven days a week.

128
00:10:46,384 --> 00:10:48,054
Don't listen to it.

129
00:10:48,597 --> 00:10:50,351
The network shuts
down the schools.

130
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:52,856
The kids
are brainwashed

131
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:54,944
By the TV.

132
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,781
We can
jam the network

133
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,120
Once we find
the satellite uplink.

134
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:01,500
We'll broadcast
the truth.

135
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,546
Truth? Hasn't been
popular lately.

136
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,800
Can't find the code
or the uplink

137
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,222
Don't know where

138
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:09,934
The network hid
something that big.

139
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:12,732
[beeping]

140
00:11:12,941 --> 00:11:14,152
Steve, would you mind?

141
00:11:16,365 --> 00:11:17,701
Good-bye, my lovely.

142
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:32,273
You're one of the cops

143
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,320
Who locked up
all my friends.

144
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:36,741
People like you

145
00:11:37,409 --> 00:11:39,247
Turned this country
into a jail.

146
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,752
We don't want
his death
on our hands.

147
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,424
He's the Butcher
of Bakersfield.

148
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:46,763
Come on, Mic.

149
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:47,765
It's network
propaganda.

150
00:11:48,015 --> 00:11:49,769
We wouldn't be here
if he hadn't helped us.

151
00:11:51,857 --> 00:11:53,444
He's not
one of us.

152
00:11:54,112 --> 00:11:55,782
Perhaps
he's seen too much.

153
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:58,245
All I've seen is a bunch
of low foreheads

154
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:01,753
Who think they can
change the world

155
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:04,509
with dreams and talk.

156
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,805
If you're not ready
to act, shut up.

157
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:13,653
Nothing worth losing
your head over, huh?

158
00:12:18,706 --> 00:12:20,459
You got it.

159
00:12:26,723 --> 00:12:28,560
Hey, get out
of here!

160
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,682
Well, there's
your ride.

161
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,603
It's all set.

162
00:12:49,062 --> 00:12:50,774
Nothing like
first class.

163
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:53,864
Hey, senorita,
do you want to come in?

164
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:57,664
I guess this is it.

165
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:59,668
Now you, Weiss,
stay out

166
00:12:59,918 --> 00:13:01,422
of the National
Data Base.

167
00:13:01,672 --> 00:13:03,802
And you, Laughlin,
stop trying to teach

168
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,599
the constitution
to the street punks.

169
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:09,146
You can still
join us.

170
00:13:09,647 --> 00:13:10,357
No, thank you.

171
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:12,612
I'm not into politics.
I'm into survival.

172
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:15,744
In our day,
it's the same thing.

173
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,708
Laughlin, save it
for the written test.

174
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,211
Yeah!

175
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,055
Yeah!

176
00:14:11,696 --> 00:14:13,575
We need you,
Damon!

177
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:16,373
Brenda, do you have
this week's ratings,

178
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,131
or do I have
to guess?

179
00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:23,221
They're the same
as last week.

180
00:14:23,805 --> 00:14:25,643
Those were the same
last month.

181
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:28,106
We've peaked.
It's not like we dropped.

182
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:30,820
Whoa!

183
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:31,989
Sorry, Mr. Killian.

184
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,035
That's all right,
what's your name?

185
00:14:35,372 --> 00:14:36,248
Dan.

186
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,002
You're doing
good work.

187
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:38,837
Thank you.

188
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,883
Brenda, if that asshole
is mopping tomorrow,

189
00:14:42,094 --> 00:14:44,057
you'll be mopping
for the rest of the week.

190
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:47,522
Let's go!

191
00:15:28,276 --> 00:15:29,737
Security code
accepted.

192
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,079
Edward?

193
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,837
Damon, were you
down in wardrobe yet?

194
00:15:58,089 --> 00:15:59,885
Your new jackets
are fantastic.

195
00:16:00,219 --> 00:16:01,764
Who chose the colors?

196
00:16:02,098 --> 00:16:03,685
How are
my people today?

197
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,229
You're looking good.

198
00:16:05,438 --> 00:16:06,983
Tony, what have you
got for me?

199
00:16:08,152 --> 00:16:10,157
The Justice Department's
calling every 10 minutes.

200
00:16:11,535 --> 00:16:13,163
Give them
an evasive answer.

201
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,042
Tell them to go
fuck themselves.

202
00:16:16,754 --> 00:16:18,215
What have we got?

203
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:24,938
Lights.

204
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,826
Oh, God. Kitchen,
toast and coffee.

205
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,834
ICS Channel One.

206
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,388
Are you ready for pain?

207
00:16:40,638 --> 00:16:42,434
Are you ready for suffering?

208
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,937
If the answer is yes,

209
00:16:44,187 --> 00:16:46,192
Then you're ready
for Captain Freedom's workout.

210
00:16:48,446 --> 00:16:50,242
Yes, it's America's own
Captain Freedom,

211
00:16:51,912 --> 00:16:53,207
10-time national champion.

212
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:55,211
The greatest stalker
to ever play the game.

213
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,343
All right, all you runners,

214
00:16:58,927 --> 00:16:59,720
Ready, get set, go!

215
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:01,808
We interrupt
Captain Freedom's workout

216
00:17:02,184 --> 00:17:03,562
To bring you
this bulletin.

217
00:17:03,813 --> 00:17:05,733
City police are engaged in
a door-to-door search

218
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,656
For Benjamin A. Richards,
the Butcher of Bakersfield.

219
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,370
Richards was
the helicopter pilot

220
00:17:12,122 --> 00:17:13,709
who went berserk 18 months ago,

221
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,381
firing without warning

222
00:17:16,631 --> 00:17:18,260
on a crowd
of innocent civilians.

223
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,765
If you see this man,
don't approach him.

224
00:17:22,811 --> 00:17:24,482
Contact your local
block warden.

225
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:26,653
Don't make a sound.
Who are you?

226
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:30,411
A friend
of my brother's?

227
00:17:34,294 --> 00:17:36,090
What are you
talking about?

228
00:17:36,591 --> 00:17:38,219
This is
his apartment.

229
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:40,098
I moved in last month.

230
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:41,727
They told me

231
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,773
the last tenant
was taken away

232
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,612
for re-education.

233
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:49,827
Help!

234
00:17:50,078 --> 00:17:51,247
Are you the man?

235
00:17:51,497 --> 00:17:52,583
He's in my house!

236
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,295
The Butcher
of Bakersfield

237
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,214
Is in my bathroom!

238
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:57,468
That's the ticket.
no pain, no gain.

239
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,391
Let go of me!

240
00:18:00,642 --> 00:18:01,686
Let me go!

241
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:04,066
Now, listen to me.

242
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,905
This is all a lie.
I was framed.

243
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:10,037
Yeah, sure.

244
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:11,916
Now be quiet.
Stay still.

245
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,004
I'm out of here
in five minutes.

246
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,891
Hi, this is Amber.

247
00:18:21,478 --> 00:18:22,313
I'm not at home.

248
00:18:22,563 --> 00:18:24,317
I'm out having
a wonderful time.

249
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,614
So when you hear the tone,
leave your message.

250
00:18:32,084 --> 00:18:33,169
"Baby Face" march.

251
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,798
Are you kidding me?
Next!

252
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,053
How's this one?
Case 114.

253
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,391
Schoolteacher.
Killed his wife
and mother-in-law

254
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,773
at a faculty dinner.

255
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:43,942
I like that quality.

256
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:45,696
He's the sort
the neighbors say,

257
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,619
"Such a quiet man."

258
00:18:49,496 --> 00:18:50,707
But look at him.

259
00:18:50,957 --> 00:18:52,043
He weighs 120 pounds.

260
00:18:52,293 --> 00:18:54,005
He wouldn't last
3o seconds.

261
00:18:54,674 --> 00:18:55,509
Who else?

262
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,513
What about
those bank
robbers?

263
00:18:58,056 --> 00:18:59,768
They made that
suicide pact.

264
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,229
Did they commit suicide?

265
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,066
Obviously not, Damon.

266
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,071
Then they're unreliable.

267
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:07,158
I got a friend
at a talent agency.

268
00:19:08,703 --> 00:19:10,290
Hello, gorgeous.

269
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,171
Somebody with stamina.

270
00:19:13,965 --> 00:19:14,800
Tony!

271
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,762
Pipe that feed
in here now.

272
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:19,936
Look at this.

273
00:19:20,186 --> 00:19:22,065
This is yesterday's
prison break.

274
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:24,111
Look.

275
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:25,698
Look at that
mother move.

276
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,495
He's beautiful.
Who is he?

277
00:19:28,997 --> 00:19:30,291
That's Ben Richards.

278
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,212
The cop
from the massacre?

279
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,634
Sensational!

280
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,137
I want him.

281
00:19:36,387 --> 00:19:37,849
You can't have him.

282
00:19:38,183 --> 00:19:39,185
Why not?

283
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:40,396
You know our contract.

284
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,484
We never get
military prisoners.

285
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,196
He's still
at large.

286
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:45,866
They'll get him
for me.

287
00:19:46,367 --> 00:19:47,954
Cadres can't have it
both ways.

288
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:50,751
I can get 10 rating points
for his biceps alone.

289
00:19:53,424 --> 00:19:54,467
Hello, this is Killian.

290
00:19:54,718 --> 00:19:56,555
Get me the Justice
Department,

291
00:19:56,931 --> 00:19:58,142
Entertainment Division.

292
00:19:58,392 --> 00:19:59,812
No, hold that, operator.

293
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:01,900
Get me
the President's agent.

294
00:20:05,115 --> 00:20:06,075
What is this?

295
00:20:06,326 --> 00:20:07,787
That's my
synthesizer setup.

296
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,627
I'm a musician.

297
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,548
well, I'm really
a singer.

298
00:20:12,756 --> 00:20:14,719
I wrote
the network's
theme song-

299
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:17,976
We bring you joy,
we bring you strife.

300
00:20:19,646 --> 00:20:21,525
You must be
very proud of yourself.

301
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,074
It's really nothing.

302
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,079
Look at this.

303
00:20:27,454 --> 00:20:29,333
They're all
on the censored list.

304
00:20:30,377 --> 00:20:32,131
And look what
we have here.

305
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:34,678
This looks like
black-market clothing.

306
00:20:35,722 --> 00:20:37,517
And you wrote
the network jingle.

307
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,148
Come on.
Everybody does it.

308
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:42,069
Money.

309
00:20:43,447 --> 00:20:45,200
That's what I need.
Money.

310
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:47,622
Money's not going
to do you any good.

311
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,712
You don't have
a travel pass.

312
00:20:52,508 --> 00:20:54,053
You do.

313
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:56,808
Now I do.

314
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,896
Now, let's see.

315
00:21:04,491 --> 00:21:06,162
Now, where should we go?

316
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:07,874
Maybe someplace warm.

317
00:21:08,082 --> 00:21:10,087
I need to work
on my tan anyway.

318
00:21:11,005 --> 00:21:12,759
You get so pale
in prison.

319
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:15,765
There you are.

320
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:16,768
Good.

321
00:21:17,018 --> 00:21:18,521
I'm going to untie you.

322
00:21:19,022 --> 00:21:20,985
Then you're going to
get dressed.

323
00:21:21,653 --> 00:21:23,449
You're coming with me.

324
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:25,829
Oh, Yeah.
Well, why should I?

325
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,088
Because I'm going
to say...

326
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:32,468
please.

327
00:21:36,393 --> 00:21:37,896
Well...why didn't
you say so?

328
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:40,819
All flights to Pretoria,
Tutuville, and Mandelaburg

329
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:43,825
are on schedule.

330
00:21:43,992 --> 00:21:45,287
Flights to Anaconda, Chile,
are delayed several hours.

331
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:49,045
All Mideast flights
are cancelled

332
00:21:49,671 --> 00:21:50,882
until further notice.

333
00:21:51,132 --> 00:21:52,928
You'll never
pull this off.

334
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:55,308
You are unarmed,

335
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:56,561
outnumbered.

336
00:21:56,769 --> 00:21:58,273
Face it,
you're screwed.

337
00:21:58,523 --> 00:22:00,444
So why don't you
forget about this

338
00:22:01,822 --> 00:22:03,617
and turn
yourself in?

339
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:04,787
You know,

340
00:22:05,037 --> 00:22:06,666
You have a very
negative attitude.

341
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,424
Remember, I can
break your neck
like a chicken's.

342
00:22:14,724 --> 00:22:16,186
Travel pass.

343
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,902
What a beautiful
day today.

344
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:22,616
I can practically
taste those pina coladas.

345
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,082
Miss?

346
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,128
You didn't put it
in your purse again?

347
00:22:30,007 --> 00:22:31,009
Last vacation she put

348
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,888
my credit cards
in there,

349
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,059
and we couldn't find them
for a week.

350
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,734
Move it up there!

351
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:40,989
Go on! Go on!

352
00:22:42,032 --> 00:22:43,035
Can't live with them,

353
00:22:43,285 --> 00:22:45,081
and you can't live
without them.

354
00:22:50,926 --> 00:22:52,680
I'm warning you,
I get sick-

355
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,144
air sick, car sick.

356
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,858
I'm going to throw up
all over you.

357
00:22:59,194 --> 00:23:01,073
Go ahead. It won't show
on this shirt.

358
00:23:16,773 --> 00:23:17,191
Oow!

359
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,819
Help!
He's Ben Richards!

360
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,283
He's trying
to kidnap me!

361
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:23,162
Help!

362
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:25,333
Positive I.D.
Benjamin A. Richards.

363
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:28,381
Priority one fugitive.
All units, terminal seven.

364
00:23:47,714 --> 00:23:48,967
All right.
We're on him.
Close the Net.

365
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,284
You move
and you're dead!

366
00:24:22,663 --> 00:24:23,582
Hi, cutie pie.

367
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,503
One of us is
in deep trouble.

368
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,593
You know who I am?

369
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,722
I've seen you before.

370
00:24:31,516 --> 00:24:33,060
You're the asshole on TV.

371
00:24:35,106 --> 00:24:36,568
That's funny.
I was going to say

372
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:39,908
The same thing
about you.

373
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:41,954
I saw the video
of your prison break.

374
00:24:43,332 --> 00:24:44,919
I think we can
help each other.

375
00:24:46,422 --> 00:24:48,134
I've got the brains.
You've got talent.

376
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,932
You've got more.

377
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,811
You've got talent,
charisma,

378
00:24:53,562 --> 00:24:55,316
That's why I pulled
a few strings

379
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:58,406
to get you here.

380
00:25:00,828 --> 00:25:02,206
That's why
I'd like you

381
00:25:02,456 --> 00:25:04,461
to volunteer to appear
on tomorrow's broadcast

382
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,968
of The Running Man.

383
00:25:09,054 --> 00:25:10,557
Fuck you!

384
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,561
You're a brilliant
conversationalist, Ben.

385
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,025
A trifle limited,
but brilliant.

386
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:17,739
Take a look.

387
00:25:18,282 --> 00:25:20,244
Isn't that your old
schoolteacher buddy?

388
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,084
There's your buddy
who helped you

389
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,338
in the prison
infirmary.

390
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,050
Weiss, Laughlin.

391
00:25:27,301 --> 00:25:28,846
What are you going
to do with them?

392
00:25:30,975 --> 00:25:32,604
Well, that's really
up to you, Ben.

393
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,487
You see, I created
The Running Man,

394
00:25:37,949 --> 00:25:39,619
but I don't
make the rules.

395
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,041
I got a contract
with the government.

396
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:44,880
They send me convicts.

397
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,926
I put them on the show.

398
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,390
You know you've
got a chance,

399
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:51,895
but your buddies, Ben,

400
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,233
get the "B" list.

401
00:25:54,484 --> 00:25:55,361
If you don't do

402
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:57,156
The Running Man
tomorrow,

403
00:25:57,615 --> 00:25:59,411
Weiss and Laughlin
are going to go on

404
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:03,252
in your place.

405
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:04,923
What do you say?

406
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,585
We'll see how far
this clown runs
when we're done.

407
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:25,759
Starting Barium IV.

408
00:26:27,095 --> 00:26:28,431
That's a go.

409
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:30,352
Reading all systems.

410
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:32,565
Your bird is singing
loud and clear.

411
00:26:35,446 --> 00:26:36,907
All systems check out.

412
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:38,786
Mandibular restraint.

413
00:26:45,426 --> 00:26:47,096
Interphalangic injection.

414
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,568
Deltoid I.M. injection.

415
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,036
Procedure completed.

416
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,831
Takes care of him.

417
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:05,301
Sons of bitches!

418
00:27:05,552 --> 00:27:07,389
He's wrapped.
Knock him out
'til showtime.

419
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:18,913
Ugh!

420
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:23,715
Uhh!

421
00:27:42,505 --> 00:27:44,259
These guys
never stop competing.

422
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:46,263
I get thirsty
just watching them.

423
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,226
I can't afford
that filled-up feeling.

424
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,566
That's why I drink
Cadre Cola.

425
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:55,700
It hits the spot.

426
00:27:57,412 --> 00:27:59,500
The capture of renegade
police officer Ben Richards

427
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:02,673
was filmed yesterday

428
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:04,469
by runway security cameras.

429
00:28:04,719 --> 00:28:06,682
Richards' hostage,
Amber Mendez,

430
00:28:07,016 --> 00:28:07,851
was unharmed.

431
00:28:08,102 --> 00:28:09,688
Some airport personnel
were not so lucky,

432
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:12,444
like the ticket agent
and security guard

433
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:15,451
Richards shot
at point-blank range.

434
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:17,664
But that's not true.

435
00:28:17,914 --> 00:28:19,459
They're at
Cadre Memorial Hospital,

436
00:28:19,793 --> 00:28:21,589
where they remain
in guarded condition.

437
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:24,428
And now, back to
climbing for dollars.

438
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:40,796
Yaah !

439
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,851
Mr. Richards.

440
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,813
I'm your court-appointed
theatrical agent.

441
00:28:58,459 --> 00:28:59,920
It's time.

442
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:12,948
And digital effects
number one.

443
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:15,829
Roll process mod.

444
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,297
OK, you guys,
hey, here we are.

445
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,013
Come on, move! Move!

446
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:30,527
Big crowd tonight.

447
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:33,199
Better there
than in the streets.

448
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:53,743
Buzzsaw!

449
00:29:53,994 --> 00:29:55,580
Who's your
number one stalker?

450
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,094
Hey, Buzzsaw!
slice those runners!

451
00:30:03,681 --> 00:30:05,142
You guys see that?

452
00:30:05,643 --> 00:30:07,314
Buzzsaw touched me!

453
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:00,594
Don't touch the hair!

454
00:31:18,173 --> 00:31:19,551
Yeah!
Whoo!

455
00:31:20,636 --> 00:31:21,931
Oh, Yeah!

456
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,392
Go!

457
00:31:33,414 --> 00:31:35,167
Do you have
any more change?

458
00:31:36,336 --> 00:31:37,380
I ran out.

459
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:38,800
$6.00.
This place-

460
00:31:39,051 --> 00:31:40,220
you're lucky
to be alive.

461
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,558
That guy,
he's killed, what-
6o, 8o, 1oo people?

462
00:31:44,688 --> 00:31:46,483
Not according to him,
he hasn't.

463
00:31:47,276 --> 00:31:48,654
That's what
they all say.

464
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:50,700
"Whereas the victim
contests this,

465
00:31:51,285 --> 00:31:52,872
"and whereas network
and victim

466
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:54,834
"have in past
been combatants

467
00:31:55,544 --> 00:31:56,045
"ad hoc de facto,

468
00:31:56,296 --> 00:31:58,133
"the parties herein
have agreed to disagree.

469
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,763
"This is mutually consented
to be de jure,

470
00:32:02,183 --> 00:32:03,979
"and parties have certain
obligations to each other.

471
00:32:05,482 --> 00:32:07,069
Respective rights
and obligations..."

472
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,323
Boy, lucky he didn't
kill you, too,

473
00:32:11,202 --> 00:32:12,873
or rape you
and kill you,

474
00:32:14,209 --> 00:32:16,088
or kill you,
then rape you.

475
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:19,553
"Conflicts
between your estate..."

476
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:21,683
I mean,
a guy like that...

477
00:32:22,727 --> 00:32:24,397
what would stop him?

478
00:32:24,731 --> 00:32:25,733
Yeah.

479
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:26,777
What would?

480
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,990
Look, Amy, I have to
pass on that drink.

481
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:32,706
I just remembered
I have some paperwork to do,

482
00:32:34,335 --> 00:32:36,297
so I'll catch you
tomorrow, OK?

483
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,970
...and everyone's
favorite showman-

484
00:32:39,763 --> 00:32:41,225
Damon Killian!

485
00:32:47,154 --> 00:32:49,242
Yeah! Thank you!
You're beautiful!

486
00:32:49,951 --> 00:32:51,580
I love you, Yes!

487
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:54,294
You're beautiful!

488
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:57,342
Thank you!

489
00:32:58,094 --> 00:32:59,806
Ha ha!

490
00:33:00,098 --> 00:33:01,643
Shh!

491
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:04,232
It's...

492
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,194
showtime!

493
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:09,744
Yeah, yeah!

494
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:12,583
All right!

495
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:14,044
Now, tell me.

496
00:33:14,295 --> 00:33:16,508
What's the number-one
television show

497
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,347
in the whole wide world?

498
00:33:20,141 --> 00:33:21,727
The Running Man!

499
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:24,066
Who loves you,
and who do you love?

500
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,030
Damon!

501
00:33:27,281 --> 00:33:28,408
One more time!

502
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:29,828
Damon!

503
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,498
Yes!

504
00:33:33,377 --> 00:33:35,340
Phil, my announcer.

505
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:36,926
I heard the warm-up,

506
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,223
and I got to tell you,
honestly, Phil,

507
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,021
I don't think I've
ever heard you funnier.

508
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:44,985
I'm just kidding, guys.

509
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:46,990
You're great
at your job.

510
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,952
Too bad
it isn't music.

511
00:33:49,453 --> 00:33:50,664
"...ad infinitum

512
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:52,835
"for cassettes,
videotapes, bubble chips,

513
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:55,132
and all other methods
of recordings known or unknown."

514
00:34:03,191 --> 00:34:04,360
Sign here.

515
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,907
Hey!

516
00:34:10,957 --> 00:34:12,711
Here, use
my back, victim.

517
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:20,561
Aah!

518
00:34:20,812 --> 00:34:22,899
Don't forget
to send me a copy.

519
00:34:24,653 --> 00:34:25,530
Aah!

520
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,701
The love of my life,
my number-one fan,

521
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,461
Mrs. Mcardle!

522
00:34:32,712 --> 00:34:34,006
How you doin'?

523
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:36,011
Just fine.

524
00:34:36,261 --> 00:34:38,182
I want
a big kiss, now,

525
00:34:38,683 --> 00:34:40,729
but remember,
no tongues.

526
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:44,654
Bless you.

527
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:46,241
Sit down,
little darling.

528
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:48,746
We have one hell
of a show for you.

529
00:34:50,082 --> 00:34:51,878
Phil, please,
if you will,

530
00:34:52,462 --> 00:34:54,508
introduce tonight's
guest runner,

531
00:34:56,763 --> 00:34:58,893
and watch that screen.

532
00:34:59,728 --> 00:35:02,191
Our star runner tonight
needs no introduction.

533
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,070
he's Ben Richards,

534
00:35:04,321 --> 00:35:06,701
the brutal slayer
of 60 men, women, and children

535
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,125
in the Bakersfield massacre.

536
00:35:11,043 --> 00:35:12,254
Food riot in progress.

537
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:14,634
Approximately
1500 civilians.

538
00:35:15,136 --> 00:35:16,179
Moving in.

539
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,683
The crowd is unarmed.

540
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:19,812
Repeat, unarmed.
Abort attack.

541
00:35:20,063 --> 00:35:21,942
Acknowledge,
yankee nine-niner.

542
00:35:22,192 --> 00:35:23,487
The hell with you.

543
00:35:23,737 --> 00:35:24,990
Lieutenant Saunders,
take command.

544
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,286
Detain Richards
and return to base.

545
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:29,875
Acknowledge, yankee
nine-niner. Acknowledge!

546
00:35:31,044 --> 00:35:33,049
Those are innocent,
unarmed people down there!

547
00:35:34,594 --> 00:35:36,055
Cease fire! Cease fire!

548
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,189
Aah!
Aah!

549
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:45,826
Oh!

550
00:35:57,768 --> 00:35:58,854
Aah!

551
00:35:59,897 --> 00:36:02,403
Well, we all know
the aftermath-

552
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:04,365
grieving parents,

553
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,660
orphaned children,

554
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:07,580
a nation shocked
to its very core.

555
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:10,587
Here he is,

556
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,466
ready to pay the price
for our home audience,

557
00:36:16,057 --> 00:36:17,685
in person,
the Butcher of Bakersfield!

558
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:32,676
Look!

559
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:39,523
Get him!

560
00:36:50,714 --> 00:36:52,468
Boo! Boo!
Boo!

561
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,548
Now, Ben Richards
could have gone to prison,

562
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:13,471
but instead, he volunteered
for The Running Man.

563
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:17,730
Oh, excuse me.

564
00:37:17,939 --> 00:37:19,149
...our fabulous prizes,

565
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,446
like a trial by jury,
suspended sentence,

566
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:23,951
maybe even a full pardon,

567
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,498
like our previous winners
Whitman, Price, and Haddad!

568
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:30,173
you remember them!
Whitman, Price, and Haddad!

569
00:37:32,678 --> 00:37:34,140
There they are!

570
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:35,559
At this very moment,

571
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,814
They're basking
under the Maui sun,

572
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,113
their debt to society
paid in full.

573
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:43,702
Speaking of prizes,

574
00:37:43,952 --> 00:37:45,581
you don't have to be
a menace to society

575
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:48,754
to be a winner.

576
00:37:49,046 --> 00:37:50,633
Phil, tell our friends
what they can win today.

577
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,224
Damon, how about
a year's supply

578
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:56,729
of Orthopure
procreation pills,

579
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,107
both adult
and kiddie sizes,

580
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,237
and the latest edition
of The Running Man home game.

581
00:38:03,243 --> 00:38:04,830
Ben, I know
you're dying to show us

582
00:38:07,001 --> 00:38:08,839
the same determination
you showed up in Bakersfield.

583
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:11,928
Well, first, I've got
a little surprise for you.

584
00:38:14,601 --> 00:38:15,561
Ha ha ha!

585
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:17,357
We all know
you're a tough guy, Ben,

586
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:20,405
but that doesn't mean
you're a loner.

587
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:23,620
It takes a big man
to admit he needs friends.

588
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:27,754
We didn't want to break up
a winning team,

589
00:38:29,424 --> 00:38:31,136
so here they are,
right by your side.

590
00:38:32,472 --> 00:38:34,142
Ladies and gentlemen,
Ben's buddies,

591
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:39,111
Harold Weiss
and William Laughlin.

592
00:38:43,537 --> 00:38:44,832
Son of a bitch!

593
00:38:49,467 --> 00:38:50,803
You know how this works.

594
00:38:51,053 --> 00:38:52,223
The game zone is divided
into 400 square blocks

595
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,732
left over from
the big quake of '97.

596
00:38:58,987 --> 00:39:00,615
We will never forget that.

597
00:39:01,492 --> 00:39:02,661
Once inside the zone,

598
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,415
runners have three hours to go
through all four game quads.

599
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:10,303
They'll need every second

600
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,432
because you know
who's on their tail?

601
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:15,313
The stalkers!

602
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:16,608
Who?

603
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:17,986
The stalkers!

604
00:39:18,278 --> 00:39:19,865
And you know
what happens then!

605
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,038
Anything goes!

606
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:24,500
What?

607
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,836
Anything goes!

608
00:39:26,796 --> 00:39:27,590
Right!

609
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,218
Without further ado,

610
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,055
it's time
to start running!

611
00:39:42,872 --> 00:39:44,292
on your marks...

612
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:46,588
get set...

613
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:47,883
Killian...

614
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,720
I'll be back.

615
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:55,023
Only in a rerun.

616
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,904
Go!

617
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,165
Go!

618
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,796
Go!

619
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,675
Yes!

620
00:41:00,496 --> 00:41:01,707
Ha ha ha!

621
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,131
Go, go, go!

622
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,356
"Edited for television."

623
00:41:20,037 --> 00:41:21,415
"Raw footage."

624
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:32,856
Huh!

625
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,316
Edith Wiggins,
come on down!

626
00:41:55,404 --> 00:41:56,573
Oh!

627
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,628
Yeah!

628
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,256
Ha ha ha!

629
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:07,555
Whoa, whoa, Edith.

630
00:42:07,806 --> 00:42:08,975
You look like you've done
a little stalking yourself.

631
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:13,568
You give me
the name of the stalker

632
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,284
that we send out
to hunt down those criminals.

633
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,877
Give me
10 seconds, please.

634
00:42:25,134 --> 00:42:26,429
Come on, come on.

635
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:27,974
Place your bets.

636
00:42:28,391 --> 00:42:29,644
Dynamo, 3 to 1.

637
00:42:34,487 --> 00:42:35,782
Time's up.

638
00:42:36,032 --> 00:42:37,703
No more bets.
Back off!

639
00:42:39,248 --> 00:42:40,709
Come on!

640
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:42,504
They're all so good.

641
00:42:42,964 --> 00:42:43,423
Quickly!

642
00:42:43,632 --> 00:42:45,594
My husband and son
have their favorites,

643
00:42:46,722 --> 00:42:48,768
but I like my men
big and cuddly.

644
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:51,899
Subzero!

645
00:42:52,192 --> 00:42:53,277
All right! OK!

646
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:55,282
We're looking
for Subzero!

647
00:42:59,917 --> 00:43:01,503
Yeah!

648
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:07,474
And now, our first stalker
of the evening,

649
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:10,606
a cadre trophy champion
with over 30 lifetime kills,

650
00:43:12,568 --> 00:43:14,155
let's welcome
the incredible iceman,

651
00:43:16,285 --> 00:43:17,871
who slices his enemies
limb from limb

652
00:43:19,542 --> 00:43:21,087
into quivering bloody sushi,

653
00:43:21,755 --> 00:43:23,258
Professor Subzero!

654
00:43:27,934 --> 00:43:29,187
Yeah!

655
00:43:29,479 --> 00:43:30,523
Oh!

656
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:34,448
Yeeah!

657
00:43:35,158 --> 00:43:36,453
Yaaah!

658
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:45,472
Let's go!

659
00:43:47,142 --> 00:43:48,520
Come on!
Let's go!

660
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:12,154
Here in the locker room,

661
00:44:12,362 --> 00:44:13,532
there's a lot of excitement,
a lot of adrenaline.

662
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:17,290
The stalkers know

663
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,127
there's 400 square blocks
of game zone,

664
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:21,966
and anything can happen
in the next three hours.

665
00:44:24,137 --> 00:44:25,348
I remember once-

666
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:27,269
Sorry, cap.
I've just been informed

667
00:44:28,689 --> 00:44:30,317
the runners
have entered the first quad.

668
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:33,866
Let's go there, live!

669
00:44:41,884 --> 00:44:42,969
Faster!

670
00:44:43,178 --> 00:44:44,222
Faster!

671
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,226
Keep going!

672
00:44:51,487 --> 00:44:52,364
Give it to me!

673
00:44:52,573 --> 00:44:54,577
You pay your money,
you make your choice.

674
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:57,584
How about you?

675
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:06,937
It's cold.

676
00:45:22,846 --> 00:45:24,349
What is this?

677
00:45:34,704 --> 00:45:36,500
I guess
they want us to stay.

678
00:45:45,185 --> 00:45:46,730
Subzero does it again!

679
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,233
A triple hit!

680
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:51,114
Let's get out of here!

681
00:45:51,365 --> 00:45:52,784
Weiss, come on!
Go!

682
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:11,032
Go!

683
00:46:17,963 --> 00:46:19,090
Aah!

684
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,103
Banzai!

685
00:46:25,604 --> 00:46:27,316
Oh, look at this.
an ICS home video.

686
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:30,156
Yeah!

687
00:46:30,406 --> 00:46:31,951
And The Running Man
home version

688
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:36,168
right here for you.

689
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,797
Get me out of here!

690
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:41,304
Hang on, Weiss.
I'm coming.

691
00:46:44,603 --> 00:46:45,689
Eeah!

692
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,403
Ah!

693
00:46:53,455 --> 00:46:54,499
Richards?

694
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,420
Will! Get me out
of here, you guys!

695
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:05,147
Will, look out!

696
00:47:14,166 --> 00:47:15,544
Kill that son of a bitch !

697
00:47:24,229 --> 00:47:25,607
Come on!
Come on! Yeah!

698
00:47:34,501 --> 00:47:35,628
Aah!

699
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:39,804
Uugh!

700
00:47:41,683 --> 00:47:43,186
Uugh!

701
00:47:44,856 --> 00:47:46,276
Oh!

702
00:48:09,576 --> 00:48:11,037
Hey, Killian!

703
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:15,087
Here is Subzero-

704
00:48:16,298 --> 00:48:17,718
now plain zero.

705
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:31,289
Ladies and gentlemen,

706
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,295
this is just horrible.

707
00:48:35,088 --> 00:48:36,842
Words can't express
what we're all feeling

708
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:40,182
at this very moment.

709
00:48:42,855 --> 00:48:44,358
A great champion has fallen.

710
00:48:46,154 --> 00:48:47,949
We'll be back right after
these important messages.

711
00:48:51,999 --> 00:48:53,043
Pull!

712
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:55,632
You all right?

713
00:48:55,883 --> 00:48:57,219
Yeah. Boy.

714
00:48:59,098 --> 00:49:00,684
What the hell's that?

715
00:49:00,977 --> 00:49:02,146
It's gas.

716
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,858
Let's get out
of here.

717
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,737
Sure glad we
took care of Subzero.

718
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:08,409
Yeah, he was a real
pain in the neck.

719
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,622
I know
a stalker died.

720
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:12,835
Well, it had to happen
sooner or later.

721
00:49:14,798 --> 00:49:16,176
Yeah, well, it is
a contact sport, right?

722
00:49:19,391 --> 00:49:20,936
Yes, you guys
at justice,

723
00:49:21,353 --> 00:49:22,898
you cannot
have it both ways.

724
00:49:23,942 --> 00:49:24,903
You want ratings,

725
00:49:25,153 --> 00:49:26,823
you want people
in front of the TV sets

726
00:49:28,828 --> 00:49:30,080
instead of picket lines-

727
00:49:30,331 --> 00:49:32,252
well, you ain't
gonna get that

728
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,673
with reruns
of Gilligan's Island.

729
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:36,135
Gilligan's Island.

730
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,515
da da-da da

731
00:49:38,807 --> 00:49:41,271
Yeah, the one with the boat.

732
00:49:52,294 --> 00:49:53,839
Yeah, Buzzsaw!

733
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:54,674
Leon?

734
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,846
I think
maybe Dynamo, but...

735
00:49:57,806 --> 00:50:00,228
but Buzzsaw was
last year's champion.

736
00:50:00,812 --> 00:50:02,566
I can't decide.

737
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:04,236
Then don't
decide, Leon.

738
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:06,867
Hard decisions
call for hard solutions.

739
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,249
Here are two hard asses
ready to take charge.

740
00:50:12,003 --> 00:50:14,341
You asked for them,
you got them.

741
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:16,095
Here they are-

742
00:50:16,345 --> 00:50:18,642
Buzzsaw and Dynamo!

743
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:21,314
Phil, tell us all about
this champion tag team.

744
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:27,118
Let's give a down-home welcome
to Buzzsaw Eddie Vatowski,

745
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:30,960
last season's
leading stalker.

746
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,797
Buzzsaw's chain saws...

747
00:50:33,048 --> 00:50:35,637
can cut muscle,
sinew, bone

748
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,438
or even solid steel!

749
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:48,288
The ratings jumped
eight points.

750
00:50:48,539 --> 00:50:50,084
Make that
nine points.

751
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:51,420
I love Ben Richards.

752
00:50:51,671 --> 00:50:53,257
Want another
surprise?

753
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:54,092
What?

754
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,681
Remember the girl
who was with Richards
at the airport?

755
00:50:58,435 --> 00:50:59,646
With the cute ass?

756
00:50:59,897 --> 00:51:00,982
They caught her
downstairs.

757
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:03,237
She was pulling
the Bakersfield video.

758
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:05,993
Sensational.

759
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,208
...Dynamo!

760
00:51:40,065 --> 00:51:41,318
Thank you.
You're beautiful.

761
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:43,740
It's been
an exciting show so far.

762
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:46,454
We've had shocks,
we've had surprises.

763
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:49,085
We thought,
"why not one more surprise?"

764
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,258
Will you please
help me welcome

765
00:51:52,884 --> 00:51:55,097
our mystery contestant-

766
00:51:56,225 --> 00:51:58,688
Miss Amber Mendez!

767
00:52:02,446 --> 00:52:03,574
Let me go!

768
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:05,369
Amber, now,
I understand

769
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:06,705
that you're
single, Amber,

770
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,127
and that you live
on the west side.

771
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:12,217
Not surprisingly,
she's flaunted the law

772
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,100
and traditional morality
all of her life.

773
00:52:17,771 --> 00:52:18,815
Go ahead.

774
00:52:19,065 --> 00:52:20,986
Tell some lies
about me now.

775
00:52:22,238 --> 00:52:22,990
We don't lie.

776
00:52:23,241 --> 00:52:25,203
Phil, tell us
all about her.

777
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,800
Weiss,
what is it?

778
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,554
The camera relay.

779
00:52:33,805 --> 00:52:35,391
It's not pointing up.

780
00:52:36,394 --> 00:52:38,189
Who gives a damn?

781
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:41,780
Hey, where
are you going?

782
00:52:43,576 --> 00:52:45,789
Later, she cheated
on college exams,

783
00:52:46,457 --> 00:52:47,626
had sexual relationships

784
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,340
with two, sometimes three
different men in a year,

785
00:52:52,595 --> 00:52:55,100
and then she met
"mad dog" Ben Richards,

786
00:52:56,729 --> 00:52:58,775
her confederate, her lover.

787
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,159
That was a lie!

788
00:53:03,952 --> 00:53:04,704
Dear, dear, dear.

789
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:07,042
Let's reunite
these little lovebirds.

790
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:10,007
Go!

791
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,220
Aah!

792
00:53:27,502 --> 00:53:29,006
It's got to
be here.

793
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:30,843
What is going on?

794
00:53:31,093 --> 00:53:32,513
The relays
are the same.

795
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:34,768
They point into the middle
of the game zone.

796
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:38,317
The uplink
to the network satellite
is in there.

797
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:41,825
No wonder
Mic's people
couldn't find it.

798
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:44,914
If we find that uplink,
we can crack the code.

799
00:53:47,336 --> 00:53:48,255
Jam the network.

800
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:49,925
Forget this
crazy business!

801
00:53:50,176 --> 00:53:51,804
We got to
move on.

802
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:54,101
Let's go!
Move, move!

803
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,487
Christ!

804
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:08,632
Aah!

805
00:54:08,924 --> 00:54:10,511
Aah!

806
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,605
Stalkers,
we've got a bead-

807
00:54:15,855 --> 00:54:17,734
20 degrees north,
mark 7,

808
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:20,073
12 degrees east, mark 2.

809
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:26,127
Come on, brothers!

810
00:54:26,378 --> 00:54:28,173
Let's win one
for the zero!

811
00:54:32,056 --> 00:54:33,810
"Uplinks.
Underground."

812
00:54:34,645 --> 00:54:36,399
You guys
don't shut up,

813
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,403
I'm going to
uplink your ass.

814
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:39,990
You'll be underground!

815
00:54:40,241 --> 00:54:41,994
Watch out! The lights!

816
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:49,677
Let's go!

817
00:54:49,928 --> 00:54:50,638
Shh.

818
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,475
Someone's coming.

819
00:54:58,571 --> 00:55:00,450
Richards, wait!
It's Amber!

820
00:55:00,784 --> 00:55:02,705
What the hell
are you doing here?

821
00:55:03,624 --> 00:55:05,503
You think I'm glad
to be here?

822
00:55:06,505 --> 00:55:07,423
Who the hell is this?

823
00:55:07,674 --> 00:55:09,803
She turned me in
at the airport.
This is her reward.

824
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:14,146
Well, go ahead.
Make jokes.

825
00:55:14,397 --> 00:55:15,691
It's your fault
I'm here.

826
00:55:15,942 --> 00:55:17,988
They even think
I'm your girlfriend.

827
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:21,244
See this camera up there?

828
00:55:21,495 --> 00:55:23,207
I can strangle you
for the home audience.

829
00:55:24,794 --> 00:55:26,422
Another relay.
Quick!

830
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:27,174
Weiss!

831
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:29,095
What's he
talking about?

832
00:55:29,554 --> 00:55:30,848
Let's go.

833
00:55:31,266 --> 00:55:32,769
Weiss, over here!

834
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:42,790
Richards! Look out!

835
00:56:02,123 --> 00:56:03,459
You son of a bitch!

836
00:56:06,257 --> 00:56:07,885
Richards, help!
Wait!

837
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,643
Laughlin, move it!

838
00:56:23,084 --> 00:56:24,462
Yeah.
Let's go.

839
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,803
Give me your money.

840
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,515
OK. OK.

841
00:56:37,448 --> 00:56:39,077
Hey, man, what
are you doing?

842
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:40,497
Hey!

843
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,501
The resistance wants to
jam the network.

844
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,424
Here's our chance.

845
00:56:45,716 --> 00:56:46,635
Let's go!

846
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:48,347
No. This is
more important.

847
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:50,643
It's the uplink
to the network
satellite.

848
00:56:51,979 --> 00:56:53,733
He's going to find us.

849
00:56:54,151 --> 00:56:55,821
Weiss, come on.

850
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:04,130
Over there.

851
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:13,859
Hey!

852
00:57:15,655 --> 00:57:17,701
Who loves you,
and who do you love?

853
00:57:19,329 --> 00:57:21,083
Let me hear it.

854
00:57:21,417 --> 00:57:23,087
You've got it.

855
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,346
Who loves you,
and who do you love?

856
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:40,165
Eyaa!

857
00:57:46,345 --> 00:57:47,639
Laughlin!

858
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:50,813
Hang on, I've got you.

859
00:57:51,063 --> 00:57:52,775
Run!
Get out of here!

860
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,889
Laughlin, get up!

861
00:58:08,308 --> 00:58:09,937
Go! Go!

862
00:58:15,073 --> 00:58:16,618
Go! Go! Go!

863
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,747
Eyaa!

864
00:58:29,938 --> 00:58:31,190
Yah!

865
00:58:41,922 --> 00:58:43,133
Aah!

866
00:58:50,983 --> 00:58:52,903
There you go,
Leon.

867
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,073
Oh, wow!
Yeah!

868
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,202
The Running Man
home game.

869
00:59:05,889 --> 00:59:07,434
Aah!

870
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,446
Let's get out of here.
He'll find us.

871
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:36,538
Jackpot!

872
00:59:36,788 --> 00:59:37,665
What are you doing?

873
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:40,379
Weiss? What are
you doing?

874
00:59:43,010 --> 00:59:44,054
What's this, Weiss?

875
00:59:44,304 --> 00:59:45,849
It's the uplink interface.

876
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,687
Look out.

877
00:59:49,774 --> 00:59:51,820
Great! Hexagonal
decode system.

878
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,240
Not impossible.

879
00:59:53,491 --> 00:59:55,537
It'll just take
a little time.

880
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,877
Your name
is Amber, right?

881
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,130
Yeah.

882
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,218
Amber, I need you
to remember these numbers.

883
01:00:03,595 --> 01:00:05,224
We've got to
get them to Mic.

884
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,564
Then let's Go!

885
01:01:28,192 --> 01:01:28,944
Richards!

886
01:01:29,194 --> 01:01:30,823
I love this saw.

887
01:01:31,282 --> 01:01:32,994
This saw's part of me.

888
01:01:33,245 --> 01:01:35,082
I'm gonna make it
part of you!

889
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,258
That's all right.

890
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:01,931
Keep it!

891
01:02:24,353 --> 01:02:25,648
18, 24.

892
01:02:26,149 --> 01:02:27,402
Come on.

893
01:02:28,153 --> 01:02:29,406
18, 24.

894
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,285
61.

895
01:02:31,953 --> 01:02:32,746
b.

896
01:02:32,997 --> 01:02:34,834
Say them.
Say them!

897
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,214
18, 24, 61, b.
Can we go?

898
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:39,803
Not yet.

899
01:02:40,054 --> 01:02:41,724
What do you mean?

900
01:02:42,434 --> 01:02:44,104
17, 17.

901
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,820
4.

902
01:02:48,822 --> 01:02:50,576
17, 7, 4.

903
01:02:51,161 --> 01:02:52,914
17, 17, 4.

904
01:02:53,457 --> 01:02:55,169
Come to me,
my love.

905
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:57,841
Oh, my God.

906
01:02:58,718 --> 01:02:59,887
No!

907
01:03:02,393 --> 01:03:03,478
Aah!

908
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,222
Aah!

909
01:03:23,939 --> 01:03:25,191
No!

910
01:03:27,404 --> 01:03:28,615
Let me Go!

911
01:03:28,866 --> 01:03:30,077
Richards!

912
01:03:30,327 --> 01:03:31,413
Hey!

913
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:32,874
Light head!

914
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:34,586
Hey, christmas tree!

915
01:03:34,837 --> 01:03:36,674
Richards!

916
01:03:38,678 --> 01:03:39,555
Ahh.

917
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:41,017
Yaa!

918
01:03:43,063 --> 01:03:44,107
Yay!

919
01:03:44,357 --> 01:03:46,111
Yeah! Get him!
Yeah!

920
01:04:00,683 --> 01:04:03,022
All right!

921
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:09,786
Follow me, light bulb!

922
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:13,920
Ah, got you!

923
01:04:30,205 --> 01:04:31,290
Come on!

924
01:04:31,541 --> 01:04:33,128
All right!

925
01:04:51,584 --> 01:04:52,836
Oh, God.

926
01:04:53,087 --> 01:04:54,465
I'm stuck!

927
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,344
Somebody help me!

928
01:04:57,805 --> 01:04:59,016
God, cut!

929
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:00,770
Go to commercials.

930
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:02,273
Jesus Christ!

931
01:05:02,523 --> 01:05:04,152
I have no power.

932
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:05,906
Go to commercial!

933
01:05:11,584 --> 01:05:12,962
Kill him!

934
01:05:17,472 --> 01:05:19,518
No. I won't kill
a helpless human being,

935
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:23,861
Not even sadistic scum
like you.

936
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,577
Oh, my God!
Boo!

937
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:28,829
Boo!

938
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,374
Come on!

939
01:05:30,625 --> 01:05:32,504
Do it!

940
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:38,642
What happened
to Buzzsaw?

941
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:41,231
He had
to split.

942
01:05:41,481 --> 01:05:41,899
Boo!

943
01:05:42,149 --> 01:05:44,237
Hey, what
an incredible battle!

944
01:05:45,031 --> 01:05:46,576
Buzzsaw gone,

945
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:48,037
Dynamo down,

946
01:05:48,288 --> 01:05:50,250
but the stalk
isn't over

947
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:52,505
'til the fat lady sings,

948
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:54,426
and the very
last criminal...

949
01:05:54,676 --> 01:05:56,931
Fireball, report
to wardrobe at once.

950
01:05:57,432 --> 01:05:59,520
Fireball,
you're wanted in wardrobe.

951
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,568
And our halftime show!

952
01:06:06,743 --> 01:06:08,873
Laughlin,
break's over.

953
01:06:09,124 --> 01:06:10,752
Come on.
Let's get going.

954
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:13,591
I'm going somewhere,
but not with you.

955
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:16,514
Buzzsaw took
care of my...

956
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:18,602
Traveling
arrangements.

957
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:26,202
Oh, my God.

958
01:06:28,122 --> 01:06:29,542
Weiss?

959
01:06:29,793 --> 01:06:31,630
He is dead.

960
01:06:32,298 --> 01:06:33,885
Ohh...

961
01:06:34,845 --> 01:06:36,891
But he gave me
the code,

962
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:39,229
the satellite
uplink code.

963
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,651
The underground has
a broadcast center

964
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:43,321
in quadrant four.

965
01:06:43,572 --> 01:06:45,660
Take her. Take her
and the code to Mic.

966
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,543
Don't let us die
for nothing.

967
01:06:51,171 --> 01:06:53,384
Listen, we're
counting on you.

968
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:56,266
Don't let us down.

969
01:06:56,516 --> 01:06:58,103
I don't want to be

970
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:00,232
the only asshole
in heaven

971
01:07:02,821 --> 01:07:05,034
Ben.

972
01:07:18,855 --> 01:07:20,860
He saved my life.

973
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:24,200
It should be me
down there.

974
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:27,165
We got them?
Hey, Ben?

975
01:07:27,415 --> 01:07:29,419
I got to hand
it to you, pal.

976
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,635
You got the whole network
in an uproar.

977
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:35,307
They're shipping bicarb

978
01:07:35,558 --> 01:07:38,021
to the Justice Department
in crates.

979
01:07:38,564 --> 01:07:40,902
This call is
between us.

980
01:07:41,487 --> 01:07:43,658
It's not on the air.

981
01:07:43,909 --> 01:07:45,621
Listen carefully, Ben.

982
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:47,207
How would you like

983
01:07:47,458 --> 01:07:49,838
a three-year contract,
guaranteed,

984
01:07:50,088 --> 01:07:52,009
a cadre credit line,

985
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,097
and a beach-front condo?

986
01:07:54,348 --> 01:07:55,266
Sound impossible?

987
01:07:55,517 --> 01:07:57,688
Ben, that's
the standard deal

988
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,277
for a network stalker.

989
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:01,613
I know real talent.

990
01:08:01,864 --> 01:08:04,202
I'd hate to see you
get canceled tonight

991
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,375
when you could
go the distance.

992
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:08,711
Say the word, Ben.

993
01:08:08,962 --> 01:08:11,259
You could be
doing the stalking.

994
01:08:12,094 --> 01:08:14,181
What do you think?

995
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,775
You cold-blooded
bastard.

996
01:08:19,025 --> 01:08:21,823
I'll live to see
you eat that contract.

997
01:08:22,366 --> 01:08:23,743
Leave room for my fist

998
01:08:23,994 --> 01:08:26,583
because I'll ram it
into your stomach

999
01:08:26,917 --> 01:08:29,798
and break
your goddamn spine!

1000
01:08:37,272 --> 01:08:39,694
Damon,
it's for you.

1001
01:08:39,945 --> 01:08:40,947
W-who?

1002
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:43,369
It's the attorney
general.

1003
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:45,540
Get out.
Everybody, out.

1004
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,711
Come on.
Move.

1005
01:08:52,388 --> 01:08:53,515
Yes.

1006
01:08:53,766 --> 01:08:55,311
Fireball! Fireball!

1007
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:57,774
Fireball! Fireball!

1008
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:07,503
Come on, Fireball.

1009
01:09:13,558 --> 01:09:15,395
Yay!

1010
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:32,640
Let's go!

1011
01:09:41,868 --> 01:09:44,039
He's my hero!
He's my hero!

1012
01:10:01,159 --> 01:10:03,456
Fireball!

1013
01:10:11,013 --> 01:10:11,932
There he goes.

1014
01:10:12,183 --> 01:10:13,728
Fireball's
on his way.

1015
01:10:13,936 --> 01:10:15,899
Dynamo's down,
but not out.

1016
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:18,154
Back to you, Damon.

1017
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:19,740
All right, Agnes.

1018
01:10:19,991 --> 01:10:21,118
Big chance.

1019
01:10:21,369 --> 01:10:22,413
Win lots of prizes.

1020
01:10:22,663 --> 01:10:24,960
We've still got
two crack stalkers-

1021
01:10:25,962 --> 01:10:27,674
Dynamo and Fireball.

1022
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,472
Who will make
the next kill?

1023
01:10:30,722 --> 01:10:31,682
Oh, boy.

1024
01:10:31,933 --> 01:10:33,186
That's
a tough one.

1025
01:10:33,436 --> 01:10:35,733
Give it a try.
who do you think?

1026
01:10:37,152 --> 01:10:37,737
OK.

1027
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:40,117
I think
the next kill

1028
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,247
will be
made by...

1029
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:44,042
Ben Richards.

1030
01:10:44,293 --> 01:10:45,796
Hold it.
Hold it.

1031
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:47,967
Agnes, Richards
is a runner.

1032
01:10:48,218 --> 01:10:50,806
You've got
to pick a stalker.

1033
01:10:51,099 --> 01:10:53,312
I can pick
anyone I choose,

1034
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,274
and I choose...

1035
01:10:55,525 --> 01:10:56,945
Ben Richards.

1036
01:10:57,195 --> 01:10:57,821
Richards?

1037
01:10:58,072 --> 01:11:00,410
He's one mean
motherfucker.

1038
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:05,212
$200 on Richards!

1039
01:11:05,463 --> 01:11:07,843
Come on!
200 on Richards!

1040
01:11:08,219 --> 01:11:09,889
$200 on Richards!

1041
01:11:10,139 --> 01:11:11,642
Come on-

1042
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,313
Just do it?

1043
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:14,899
Just do it.

1044
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:15,902
OK. OK.

1045
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:18,574
You want it.
You got it.

1046
01:11:21,789 --> 01:11:23,752
Place your bet.

1047
01:11:24,044 --> 01:11:25,965
Place your bet.

1048
01:11:28,386 --> 01:11:30,600
Secret broadcast center
doesn't exist.

1049
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:32,270
There's nothing out here.

1050
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:34,984
We should have
taken that trip
to Hawaii.

1051
01:11:35,568 --> 01:11:38,157
I had the shirt,
but you fucked it up.

1052
01:11:40,621 --> 01:11:42,291
Jesus Christ!

1053
01:11:42,542 --> 01:11:44,379
Guess again.

1054
01:12:00,246 --> 01:12:01,916
Come on, keep up.

1055
01:12:02,167 --> 01:12:03,879
I'm running
too fast.

1056
01:12:04,171 --> 01:12:06,259
My feet can't keep up!

1057
01:12:06,885 --> 01:12:08,012
There he goes,

1058
01:12:08,305 --> 01:12:10,184
the number-one rusher.

1059
01:12:10,476 --> 01:12:11,061
he smells blood,

1060
01:12:11,311 --> 01:12:13,817
and nothing on earth
can stop him.

1061
01:12:14,944 --> 01:12:16,948
Wait. I don't
Want to go.

1062
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:20,790
Richards!

1063
01:12:23,128 --> 01:12:24,088
Here. This way.

1064
01:12:24,339 --> 01:12:26,677
Why? I want
to go that way.

1065
01:12:27,638 --> 01:12:28,890
Let go of me.

1066
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,519
Put me down.

1067
01:12:30,769 --> 01:12:33,149
You're going
to get us killed.

1068
01:12:36,949 --> 01:12:38,870
Aah! Stop it!

1069
01:12:40,039 --> 01:12:41,292
Richards!

1070
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,421
Let me Go!

1071
01:13:12,608 --> 01:13:14,654
Amber, get
out of here.

1072
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:18,788
Go! Now!

1073
01:13:24,843 --> 01:13:27,306
Richards!

1074
01:13:49,478 --> 01:13:51,441
Amber!

1075
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:01,421
Richards!

1076
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,657
Richards!

1077
01:14:24,386 --> 01:14:26,724
Richards.

1078
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,264
Aah!

1079
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:56,037
Whitman.

1080
01:15:06,977 --> 01:15:09,649
and Price.

1081
01:15:12,864 --> 01:15:15,495
Haddad.

1082
01:15:23,846 --> 01:15:26,351
They're Running Men.

1083
01:15:26,644 --> 01:15:29,149
Last season's winners.

1084
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:30,235
No.

1085
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:33,199
Last season's
losers.

1086
01:15:44,264 --> 01:15:46,812
Huh?

1087
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:51,739
Aah!

1088
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:54,787
Why can't I fly?
Why can't I fly?

1089
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,584
How about a light?

1090
01:15:59,756 --> 01:16:01,844
Aah!

1091
01:16:14,287 --> 01:16:16,834
What a hothead.

1092
01:16:19,506 --> 01:16:22,053
Yeah, Richards!

1093
01:16:22,513 --> 01:16:24,642
Captain Freedom
to wardrobe

1094
01:16:24,851 --> 01:16:26,688
on the double.

1095
01:16:43,223 --> 01:16:44,601
Forget it, Killian.

1096
01:16:44,852 --> 01:16:46,438
I won't do it.

1097
01:16:46,689 --> 01:16:49,278
It's no request,
It's an order.

1098
01:16:49,528 --> 01:16:51,783
I don't need this crap.

1099
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:53,620
This stuff is...

1100
01:16:53,871 --> 01:16:55,625
garbage!

1101
01:16:58,422 --> 01:16:58,715
I-

1102
01:16:59,049 --> 01:17:00,093
I used to kill
guys like this
with my hands.

1103
01:17:03,266 --> 01:17:04,978
I'm not using
any tricks.

1104
01:17:05,688 --> 01:17:08,569
This is a sport
of death and honor.

1105
01:17:08,861 --> 01:17:10,323
Code of
the gladiators!

1106
01:17:10,573 --> 01:17:12,703
Spare me the combat
zen speech.

1107
01:17:12,911 --> 01:17:14,832
What's the matter
with you?

1108
01:17:15,083 --> 01:17:17,463
Can't you see
what's going on?

1109
01:17:17,713 --> 01:17:19,133
This isn't a game!

1110
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:21,764
They're betting on
Richards up there!

1111
01:17:22,306 --> 01:17:23,476
Bullshit!

1112
01:17:23,726 --> 01:17:25,605
Get out of here.

1113
01:17:25,856 --> 01:17:27,985
Get him
out of here!

1114
01:17:28,236 --> 01:17:29,572
What's the matter?

1115
01:17:29,864 --> 01:17:31,576
Steroids
make you deaf?

1116
01:17:31,869 --> 01:17:34,499
Get him out
of here now!

1117
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,654
Now what?

1118
01:17:48,905 --> 01:17:51,452
Let's find Mic's
secret broadcast center,

1119
01:17:52,663 --> 01:17:54,625
if it even exists.

1120
01:17:55,085 --> 01:17:57,506
Oh, shit!

1121
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:01,056
Let's try that way.

1122
01:18:07,194 --> 01:18:08,739
We're trapped.

1123
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:10,826
Subzero,

1124
01:18:11,077 --> 01:18:12,831
Fireball,

1125
01:18:13,081 --> 01:18:14,292
and Buzzsaw.

1126
01:18:14,501 --> 01:18:17,006
Say their names
with reverent pride.

1127
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:20,472
They punished crime

1128
01:18:20,931 --> 01:18:22,560
and served the law.

1129
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:24,355
As patriots,
they died.

1130
01:18:27,111 --> 01:18:28,990
I hate
third-act problems.

1131
01:18:30,243 --> 01:18:31,621
Roll...

1132
01:18:31,871 --> 01:18:33,082
stock.

1133
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:35,295
Freeze in
digital memory.

1134
01:18:36,214 --> 01:18:37,174
and...

1135
01:18:37,383 --> 01:18:39,387
activate
traveling matte.

1136
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:41,851
Tony,
this better work,

1137
01:18:42,101 --> 01:18:44,147
or you'll be
a digital memory.

1138
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:46,026
Take it easy,
Damon.

1139
01:18:46,277 --> 01:18:48,699
We're loading
Richards' image
onto the data base.

1140
01:18:49,617 --> 01:18:51,747
When he's mapped
onto the stunt double,

1141
01:18:52,707 --> 01:18:54,377
you'll never
know the difference.

1142
01:18:54,628 --> 01:18:57,092
All right, boys.
Let's see you dance.

1143
01:18:58,637 --> 01:18:59,346
Sensational.

1144
01:18:59,639 --> 01:19:01,559
I love it!

1145
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:07,530
Mr. Richards,
you're so easily caught.

1146
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,543
Welcome
to the people's network.

1147
01:19:13,794 --> 01:19:16,257
We've been
waiting for you.

1148
01:19:16,508 --> 01:19:17,969
This is nice, Mic,

1149
01:19:18,178 --> 01:19:20,809
but you could've
gotten off your asses

1150
01:19:21,101 --> 01:19:22,228
and helped us.

1151
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:23,940
We'd have been seen.

1152
01:19:24,191 --> 01:19:26,195
The government
would have found us.

1153
01:19:26,404 --> 01:19:28,826
Laughlin, Weiss
would have died
for nothing.

1154
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,916
They didn't.

1155
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,338
I have
the uplink code.

1156
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:37,219
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've got an update

1157
01:19:37,803 --> 01:19:39,473
on tonight's
incredible action.

1158
01:19:39,724 --> 01:19:42,021
The runners have entered
the final quad.

1159
01:19:42,939 --> 01:19:45,194
Captain Freedom has hung up
his announcer's mike

1160
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:47,741
and come out
of retirement.

1161
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,996
He's ready for
the final conflict.

1162
01:19:51,165 --> 01:19:53,211
Let's go now, live,
to the game zone!

1163
01:19:54,798 --> 01:19:56,134
Aah!

1164
01:20:11,583 --> 01:20:13,003
Uh!

1165
01:21:15,929 --> 01:21:17,098
Aah!

1166
01:21:17,432 --> 01:21:19,060
Ha ha ha!

1167
01:21:19,269 --> 01:21:20,856
Yes, it's all over!

1168
01:21:21,106 --> 01:21:22,150
What a colossal fight!

1169
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:24,363
This is an incredible
moment in sports.

1170
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:27,161
Captain Freedom, out of
retirement and undefeated-

1171
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:29,833
proving that right and might are one and the same!

1172
01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:36,807
Damn that Killian!

1173
01:21:37,015 --> 01:21:39,312
You should be happy.
We're officially dead.

1174
01:21:40,732 --> 01:21:42,694
We can do anything.

1175
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:44,323
Don't you understand?

1176
01:21:44,615 --> 01:21:46,744
They'll never
let us out alive.

1177
01:21:47,329 --> 01:21:49,083
They can't afford it.

1178
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:51,045
They'll hunt us down.

1179
01:21:51,296 --> 01:21:52,674
Off camera, of course.

1180
01:21:52,966 --> 01:21:54,970
OK. Dismantle
all the overlays.

1181
01:21:55,221 --> 01:21:56,807
Put
the digital matte

1182
01:21:57,100 --> 01:21:58,770
in the pixel
memory storage.

1183
01:21:59,021 --> 01:22:01,025
The damn thing
worked like a charm.

1184
01:22:02,069 --> 01:22:03,739
It should.
Editel charged us

1185
01:22:03,989 --> 01:22:06,244
an arm and a leg
for the software.

1186
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:09,585
Damon! You didn't
have to kill him!

1187
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:11,756
It's part
of life, Brenda.

1188
01:22:12,006 --> 01:22:14,261
You better fuckin'
get used to it.

1189
01:22:15,222 --> 01:22:17,268
That's one for
the award show.

1190
01:22:17,518 --> 01:22:19,773
Thank you.
You're doing nice work.

1191
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,195
Tony, you're
finally getting it.

1192
01:22:22,445 --> 01:22:25,118
You don't need guns
to jam a satellite.

1193
01:22:26,287 --> 01:22:28,375
I do,
to keep it.

1194
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:30,922
The network
will try to shunt

1195
01:22:31,172 --> 01:22:32,884
the next signal
in orbit.

1196
01:22:33,135 --> 01:22:35,849
Stevie's group
will stop them.

1197
01:22:36,099 --> 01:22:37,018
These kids?

1198
01:22:37,269 --> 01:22:39,607
This is
a bad move, Mic.

1199
01:22:39,899 --> 01:22:41,528
They need a leader,

1200
01:22:41,736 --> 01:22:42,780
Someone
with experience.

1201
01:22:43,073 --> 01:22:45,077
I thought you were
looking for the door.

1202
01:22:48,584 --> 01:22:50,630
I told Killian
I'd be back.

1203
01:22:51,507 --> 01:22:53,762
I wouldn't want
to be a liar.

1204
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,808
listen up,
everybody.

1205
01:22:56,059 --> 01:22:58,564
I want you all
to consider
yourselves

1206
01:22:58,981 --> 01:23:01,529
picked up
for the rest
of the season.

1207
01:23:02,405 --> 01:23:05,036
Are you my people
or an oil painting?

1208
01:23:05,913 --> 01:23:07,750
We're up nine points.

1209
01:23:08,042 --> 01:23:09,295
Come on, now.

1210
01:23:09,546 --> 01:23:10,255
Let's go, champ.

1211
01:23:10,506 --> 01:23:12,970
We're going to send
the uplink code
in 20 minutes.

1212
01:23:15,016 --> 01:23:17,646
10 seconds later,
I'll go on the air.

1213
01:23:18,565 --> 01:23:19,442
We'll be ready.

1214
01:23:19,692 --> 01:23:21,947
If you want to
make an impression,

1215
01:23:23,116 --> 01:23:24,285
forget the speech.

1216
01:23:24,494 --> 01:23:25,914
Try this instead.

1217
01:23:26,164 --> 01:23:26,749
What is it?

1218
01:23:26,999 --> 01:23:29,421
The original video
from the Bakersfield
massacre

1219
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,052
before they edited
for broadcasting.

1220
01:23:43,869 --> 01:23:45,622
Where did you
hide that?

1221
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,506
It's none
of your business.

1222
01:24:01,865 --> 01:24:03,744
Hey,
what the hell-uh!

1223
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:19,069
Six minutes.

1224
01:24:19,319 --> 01:24:21,282
Begin satellite
coding sequence.

1225
01:24:21,532 --> 01:24:23,620
Load uplink code into
transponder grid.

1226
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:27,127
Shunt power
to main circuits.

1227
01:24:27,879 --> 01:24:30,426
Mr. Spock,
you have the com.

1228
01:24:31,554 --> 01:24:33,850
Who's Mr. Spock?

1229
01:24:49,300 --> 01:24:51,972
Come on.
Let me hear it now.

1230
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:53,893
Whoo! Whoo!

1231
01:24:54,143 --> 01:24:56,607
Welcome to the postgame
wrap-up show.

1232
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,657
Ladies,
I loved you.

1233
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:02,494
Thank you,
young man.

1234
01:25:02,745 --> 01:25:04,833
Hello, you're
on the air.

1235
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:06,795
Hi, Damon.
I'm Wendy.

1236
01:25:07,087 --> 01:25:09,635
I have a question
about Dynamo.

1237
01:25:09,843 --> 01:25:11,555
Is he seriously hurt?

1238
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:13,434
He'll be fine.

1239
01:25:13,685 --> 01:25:14,395
Good luck.

1240
01:25:14,645 --> 01:25:16,566
He's under
factory warranty.

1241
01:25:16,817 --> 01:25:18,069
You, too.

1242
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:19,322
You're on the air.

1243
01:25:19,614 --> 01:25:21,744
I feel bad about
the dead stalkers.

1244
01:25:22,412 --> 01:25:25,251
May I make a donation
to their families?

1245
01:25:26,045 --> 01:25:26,880
What a darling.

1246
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:29,260
Send your checks
to the patriot's fund,

1247
01:25:29,970 --> 01:25:31,807
care of this station-

1248
01:25:32,224 --> 01:25:33,602
3,

1249
01:25:33,853 --> 01:25:35,022
2,

1250
01:25:35,314 --> 01:25:36,442
1.

1251
01:25:36,692 --> 01:25:37,778
That's it.

1252
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:38,822
We got that baby!

1253
01:25:39,072 --> 01:25:41,661
Those contributions
are tax deductible.

1254
01:25:43,624 --> 01:25:46,379
Who loves you,
and who do you love?

1255
01:25:47,423 --> 01:25:48,843
Damon!

1256
01:25:49,094 --> 01:25:49,887
Yes!

1257
01:25:50,137 --> 01:25:50,472
Yes!

1258
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:52,643
Yes!

1259
01:25:53,269 --> 01:25:55,232
Hey, what's
going on?

1260
01:25:55,482 --> 01:25:57,027
We don't lie...

1261
01:25:57,278 --> 01:25:58,280
like our
previous winners,

1262
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:00,576
Whitman, Price,
and Haddad.

1263
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:03,708
There they are,
at this very moment,

1264
01:26:05,128 --> 01:26:07,215
basking under the Maui sun,

1265
01:26:07,466 --> 01:26:10,264
their debt to society
paid in full.

1266
01:26:11,057 --> 01:26:12,059
Watch...

1267
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:13,562
that screen.

1268
01:26:13,855 --> 01:26:15,107
yankee nine-niner.

1269
01:26:15,358 --> 01:26:16,903
What's
the crowd's status?

1270
01:26:17,153 --> 01:26:18,072
Food riot in progress.

1271
01:26:18,322 --> 01:26:21,037
Approximately
1500 civilians.

1272
01:26:21,287 --> 01:26:23,041
No weapons evident.

1273
01:26:23,333 --> 01:26:24,586
Proceed with plan alpha.

1274
01:26:24,836 --> 01:26:25,964
Eliminate anything moving.

1275
01:26:26,172 --> 01:26:27,759
The crowd is unarmed.

1276
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:30,014
There are lots
of women and children.

1277
01:26:30,223 --> 01:26:31,601
All they want is food!

1278
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:34,190
Proceed with plan alpha.
All rioters must be eliminated.

1279
01:26:36,361 --> 01:26:38,282
I won't fire
at helpless people.

1280
01:26:40,369 --> 01:26:42,040
Where's it coming from?

1281
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,334
The network
satellite.

1282
01:26:43,585 --> 01:26:45,505
Abort mission.
Return to base.

1283
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,553
Don't touch that dial.

1284
01:26:49,764 --> 01:26:51,936
Detain Richards.
Proceed as ordered.

1285
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,357
Richards, what
are you doing?

1286
01:26:59,535 --> 01:27:01,539
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

1287
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:04,337
Please bear with us!

1288
01:27:04,588 --> 01:27:06,634
We're experiencing
technical difficulties!

1289
01:27:08,012 --> 01:27:09,431
Bullshit!

1290
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:16,571
It's showtime!

1291
01:27:32,146 --> 01:27:34,443
Get the people out!
Come on!

1292
01:27:39,996 --> 01:27:40,748
Huh!

1293
01:27:40,998 --> 01:27:42,836
Uhh!

1294
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,352
Thought it was funny
out in the zone.

1295
01:27:51,229 --> 01:27:53,066
What's
the matter now?

1296
01:27:53,943 --> 01:27:55,488
Why aren't you laughing?

1297
01:27:55,738 --> 01:27:57,909
Because there's nothing funny
about a dickless moron

1298
01:27:59,037 --> 01:28:01,459
with a battery
up his ass!

1299
01:28:02,168 --> 01:28:03,338
Uhh!

1300
01:28:03,588 --> 01:28:05,258
Uhh!

1301
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,820
Out! Out!

1302
01:28:20,207 --> 01:28:22,796
I'll show you
dickless!

1303
01:28:30,855 --> 01:28:32,775
Aah! Oh! Oh!

1304
01:28:33,610 --> 01:28:35,865
Oh! Oh!

1305
01:28:36,283 --> 01:28:38,371
Aah! Aah!

1306
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,343
Get out of the way!

1307
01:29:04,593 --> 01:29:07,307
Get down! Down!

1308
01:29:10,564 --> 01:29:12,026
Aah!

1309
01:29:12,318 --> 01:29:15,032
Go!

1310
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:50,357
Hello, cutie pie.

1311
01:29:52,445 --> 01:29:54,741
One of us
is in deep trouble.

1312
01:30:02,383 --> 01:30:04,721
Ha ha ha!

1313
01:30:11,652 --> 01:30:13,865
Sven, do you
want to talk
to Mr. Richards?

1314
01:30:23,093 --> 01:30:25,724
Well?

1315
01:30:27,645 --> 01:30:30,317
I got to score
some steroids.

1316
01:30:37,165 --> 01:30:39,545
You look pissed, Ben.

1317
01:30:43,136 --> 01:30:45,808
Believe me,
you got every right to be.

1318
01:30:46,268 --> 01:30:48,356
But will you
let me explain?

1319
01:30:49,191 --> 01:30:50,485
This is television.

1320
01:30:50,736 --> 01:30:52,907
It's nothing to do
with people.

1321
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:54,535
It's ratings.

1322
01:30:54,786 --> 01:30:57,208
For 50 years,
we've told them what to eat,

1323
01:30:58,627 --> 01:31:00,673
what to drink,
what to wear.

1324
01:31:01,216 --> 01:31:02,678
Ben, don't you
understand?

1325
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,431
Americans
love television.

1326
01:31:04,682 --> 01:31:06,853
They wean
their kids on it.

1327
01:31:07,104 --> 01:31:09,860
They love game shows,
they love wrestling.

1328
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:12,198
They love sports
and violence.

1329
01:31:12,908 --> 01:31:14,787
So what do we do?

1330
01:31:15,037 --> 01:31:17,167
We give them
what they want!

1331
01:31:17,751 --> 01:31:19,046
We're
number one, Ben.

1332
01:31:19,296 --> 01:31:21,593
That's
all that counts.

1333
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:24,641
Believe me.
I've done this
for 30 years.

1334
01:31:25,267 --> 01:31:27,689
I haven't been
in show business

1335
01:31:27,940 --> 01:31:29,527
as long as you have,

1336
01:31:29,777 --> 01:31:31,280
but I'm giving
the audience

1337
01:31:31,531 --> 01:31:34,203
what I think
they want.

1338
01:31:34,454 --> 01:31:35,957
Aah!

1339
01:31:36,207 --> 01:31:37,377
Ooh!

1340
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:41,385
You bastard!

1341
01:31:41,636 --> 01:31:43,055
Drop dead!

1342
01:31:43,306 --> 01:31:45,769
I don't do requests.

1343
01:31:52,367 --> 01:31:54,663
No!

1344
01:32:26,231 --> 01:32:28,193
Aaaahhhhh!

1345
01:32:37,045 --> 01:32:39,467
Well, that hit the spot.

1346
01:32:40,052 --> 01:32:42,557
Yeah!

1347
01:32:44,144 --> 01:32:46,357
Yah hah!

1348
01:32:46,607 --> 01:32:47,526
Yee hah!

1349
01:32:47,776 --> 01:32:50,198
All right! Yeah!

1350
01:32:57,756 --> 01:33:00,595
Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards!

1351
01:33:03,435 --> 01:33:05,230
Richards! Richards! Richards!

1352
01:33:05,481 --> 01:33:07,485
Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards!
Richards! Richards!

1353
01:33:21,390 --> 01:33:23,937
This is no game

1354
01:33:25,523 --> 01:33:27,152
standing in the dark

1355
01:33:27,402 --> 01:33:29,448
I swear I heard you
calling my name

1356
01:33:33,457 --> 01:33:35,461
and I knew
things had changed

1357
01:33:36,714 --> 01:33:38,092
no pain, no gain

1358
01:33:41,683 --> 01:33:42,476
somethin' in your eyes

1359
01:33:42,727 --> 01:33:43,896
just told me
that this nightmare would end

1360
01:33:49,115 --> 01:33:50,744
and I had found a friend

1361
01:33:53,834 --> 01:33:54,836
shout it
from the highest steeple

1362
01:33:57,926 --> 01:33:59,554
let it out
to all the people

1363
01:34:03,145 --> 01:34:03,897
you hit the right spot

1364
01:34:07,112 --> 01:34:07,864
no more lonely nights

1365
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:12,331
with a restless heart

1366
01:34:15,547 --> 01:34:16,173
roll the dice

1367
01:34:19,472 --> 01:34:20,223
make a brand-new start

1368
01:34:24,357 --> 01:34:25,401
when the world you knew
got shattered

1369
01:34:28,199 --> 01:34:29,201
you and me
were all that mattered

1370
01:34:31,706 --> 01:34:32,917
just one way I'm gonna lose
this restless heart

1371
01:34:37,552 --> 01:34:38,262
runnin' away with you

1372
01:34:46,613 --> 01:34:47,156
human again

1373
01:34:50,997 --> 01:34:51,749
I take you in my arms

1374
01:34:52,124 --> 01:34:53,210
and hold you
'til the fear is all gone

1375
01:34:58,555 --> 01:34:59,306
and now the race is won

1376
01:35:03,315 --> 01:35:04,317
shout it
from the highest steeple

1377
01:35:07,407 --> 01:35:08,284
let it out
to all the people

1378
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:14,589
hey!

1379
01:35:14,839 --> 01:35:15,800
Scream it
on the loudest speaker

1380
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:19,808
burnin'
like the highest fever

1381
01:35:24,318 --> 01:35:25,028
you hit the right spot

1382
01:35:28,368 --> 01:35:29,120
no more lonely nights

1383
01:35:32,961 --> 01:35:33,671
with a restless heart

1384
01:35:36,552 --> 01:35:37,137
roll the dice

1385
01:35:40,644 --> 01:35:41,354
make a brand-new start

1386
01:35:45,321 --> 01:35:46,365

1389
01:36:00,645 --> 01:36:01,355
runnin' away with you

1390
01:36:34,092 --> 01:36:34,801
there's a new horizon

1391
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:37,933
that we're both heading to

1392
01:36:40,856 --> 01:36:41,816
it's out there
in the distance

1393
01:36:44,823 --> 01:36:45,616
and it's playin' our tune

1394
01:36:49,124 --> 01:36:49,708
restless heart

1395
01:36:50,961 --> 01:36:51,712
runnin' away with you

1396
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:00,397

with a restless heart

1421
