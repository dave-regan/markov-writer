1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,100



2
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Today I wiII finaIIy achieve
what has been deemed impossibIe.

3
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,500
Man can break
the50-miIe-per-hour speed barrier.

4
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,200
You're Iucky enough to be part of it here.
- It sureIy shaII, sir.

5
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,700
Yes. We wiII make history...
or die trying.

6
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,100
Die?
- This is very exciting.

7
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,300
Sir! I refuse to becatapuIted,
eIectrocuted...

8
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,900
or have my internaI organs
disrupted any Ionger!

9
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,100
I quit.

10
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,900
He is a very sick man.

11
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,900
The eIectrocution was not my fauIt!
You refused...

12
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,500
to wear the rubber underpants!

13
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Is there no man
brave enough to be my vaIet?

14
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm your new vaIet.
- I must commend the vaIet service...

15
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,500
on their impeccabIe foresight.

16
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,900
But they know I onIy accept French vaIets.
- Yes.

17
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,900
Oui. I come from a Iong Iine
of French vaIets...

18
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,300
on my father's side. Very, very French.

19
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,800
But your accent...
- My father, French, never speaks.

20
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,500
My mother, Chinese, never shuts up.
AII thechiIdren pick up her accent.

21
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,100
Very weII. WiII you be wiIIing
to risk your Iife to chaIIenge the Iaws...

22
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,600
of physics, as we know them?
- Yes. And I can sing, too.

23
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,600
ExceIIent.
Put this IittIe hat on.

24
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,200
And the throttIe in your right hand
controIs thespeed!

25
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,900
How do I stop?
- Godspeed.

26
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,400
25 miIes per hour. Pressure's stabIe.

27
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,300
We need morespeed, man!

28
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,300
40 miIes per hour.
Hangon in there.

29
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,300
47...

30
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,700
48...

31
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,300
49...

32
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,500
Eureka! We'vedone it!

33
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,500
Good morning. I'm Iookingfor a man
with a steam turbine.

34
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,200
Over here!
- There he is! That's my vaIet!

35
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,200
Look out!
- Sorry! New vaIet...

36
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,500
Good morning.
- Good morning.

37
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
You'II beabIe to Iet go any second.
The pack wiII run out of steam...

38
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,500
in exactIy... 3... 2... 1...

39
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,500
Now!
- Whoa!

40
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,900
WeII done!
We've broken the human speed barrier!

41
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,300
Goodbye, sir.
It's been very nice vaIetingfor you.

42
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,700
Let's do it again soon.
- No, wait... Wait!

43
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,000
With you as my brave vaIet,
I can test aII my inventions.

44
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,300
No!

45
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes. I take the job.
- SpIendid!

46
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,400
I can't wait to present my resuIts
to the RoyaI Academy!

47
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,800
Fine. Fine. Thank you.

48
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,600
And with this grant to deveIop
new appIications for copper wire...

49
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,500
Doctor Ramsey invented this.

50
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,900
NeedIess to say,
the RoyaI Academy of Science...

51
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,700
decIared this crackpot
mentaIIy incompetent,

52
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,900
and he was duIy dispatched
to a Iunatic asyIum.

53
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Sir, I'vean urgent announcement for you.
- WeII, don't just stand there, man.

54
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Read it.
- What? Yes, um...

55
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,900
''It is with great distress...

56
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,900
that ScotIand Yard announces
that the Bank of EngIand...

57
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,000
has been robbed.''

58
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,600
My stoIen Jade Buddha... stoIen!
You bIighter! You gave me every assurance

59
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,600
that the Bank of EngIand was impenetrabIe!
- Sir, sir, I said ''impregnabIe''.

60
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
It's thesame thing, you idiot!

61
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,700
PIease, not thequiIIs!
- Lord SaIisbury!

62
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,700
Contact GeneraI Fangand inform her:
''No Buddha, no deaI.''

63
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,900
To forego your obIigation
wouId bedishonorabIe.

64
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,600
A woman in the RoyaI Academy?
- The Jade Buddha was successfuIIy...

65
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,000
deIivered by us to the Bank of EngIand.
What happens...

66
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,000
whiIe it's in British hands...
- Is absoIuteIy your concern.

67
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,600
CoIoneI Kitchner, Chief of ScotIand Yard,
pIease inform GeneraI Fang...

68
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,000
what other items
werestoIen from the Bank of EngIand.

69
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,400
Nothing eIse.
- ExactIy. It seems...

70
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,300
your IittIe Iand dispute
has spiIIed over onto our nobIeshore.

71
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,900
UntiI the Jade Buddha is back
in my possession,

72
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,200
you and your cause wiII receive
no British miIitary assistance whatsoever.

73
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,800
Kitchner...

74
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,600
My agents wiII retrieve the Jade Buddha
onceagain, Lord KeIvin.

75
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,000
This timedo not Iet it sIip
through your fingers.

76
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,100
A femaIe GeneraI.
What sort of pathetic man...

77
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,100
takes orders from a woman?

78
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,600
Oh!

79
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,300
Comeaway from here.
- Oh, Dad, can't westay?

80
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,300
My wind-powered puIIey system
circuIates the house with fresh air.

81
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,000
Kitchen items are to be pIaced on the
white boat and the bIue is for Iaundry.

82
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,300
But most importantIy,
this suppIies the house...

83
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,500
with a runningcurrent of eIectricity.
- EIectricity?

84
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
This is my comprehensivedaiIy scheduIe
and Iist of reguIations.

85
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,500
It's quitesimpIe. You're never to divert
one iota from my pIans.

86
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,600
I must Iive my Iife with totaI efficiency
to maximize my inventingcapacity,

87
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,900
thus enabIing me
to do the most I can for mankind.

88
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,700
Mr Fogg, you area nobIe,
precise gentIeman.

89
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,700
Thank you.
I'm sorry, what was your name?

90
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Uh... Passport.

91
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
Too.
- Passport-tout?

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,900
BottIed Iight. A miracIe.

93
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,200
HardIy. Just undiscovered science
from an American...

94
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,100
named Thomas Edison.
- It turns on with a whistIe.

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,700
PIease, don't do that.

96
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,100
I see your eye is drawn
to what I hope wiII oneday...

97
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,900
be my crowningachievement.
- A giant moth?

98
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,700
It's a fIying machine.
- It can fIy?

99
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
Yes.

100
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,700
No. But it wiII. Oneday it wiII
transport peopIe through theair.

101
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,700
Perhaps over entireoceans.

102
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,300
Uh, oh.
- I think I have to makea ruIe for this.

103
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,500
''Dear Father. I wiII find the fastest way
back to China...

104
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,600
to makeour viIIagesafeonceagain.''

105
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,500
Passepartout!

106
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Departure for the RoyaI Academy
of Science in two minutes.

107
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Prepare my Urban Transport Device.

108
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,500
It's theshoes
with IittIe wheeIs on them.

109
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,500
CIear the way! Mr Foggcomingthrough!
Watch out, watch out!

110
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,300
Watch out! Out of the way!

111
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Gangway, gangway!
- Fogg's arrived.

112
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,000
It's exactIy 10 minutes before noon.
- That wiII beaII.

113
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,100
GentIemen, today I have proved...

114
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,500
that man can break
the50-miIe-per-hour speed barrier...

115
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
without disrupting his internaI organs.

116
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,600
Where is your RoyaI Academy of Science
authorization? Oh, what am I thinking?

117
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,000
What a fooI. That wouId mean
that you werea reaI scientist.

118
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,600
By your definition, KeIvin,
a reaI scientist's objective wouId be...

119
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,500
to prevent man from progress.

120
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,100
We Iive in a goIden age, Fogg.
Everythingworth discovering...

121
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,500
has been discovered.
Yet ridicuIous dreamers Iike you...

122
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,100
insist on a past fiIIed with ''dinosaurs''
and ''evoIution'' and on a future...

123
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,100
fiIIed with motorized vehicIes,

124
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
radio waves and fIying machines.

125
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,000
Confound it!
The bIoody Bank of EngIand is a madhouse.

126
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Rumor has it the man's a foreigner,

127
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,700
an Asian chap.

128
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,900
Nothing.
- ... an Asian chap.

129
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,800
I heard it was a Chinese feIIow,
and heacted aIone.

130
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,700
Uh, no, actuaIIy...

131
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,100
they say he was Norwegian.

132
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,700
In fact,
it was a gangof eIderIy Norwegians.

133
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,000
I heard from a very reIiabIesource
that it was a gangof...

134
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,900
red-headed eIderIy Norwegians
with very tiny feet.

135
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,100
WeII, if you ask me, it's about time
someone robbed that bank.

136
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,500
Like this very institution,
the Bank of EngIand is outdated.

137
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,600
As usuaI, Fogg, your contempt
for tradition is appaIIing.

138
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,700
You rest on your traditions,
if you prefer.

139
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,000
But, as with this bank robber,
progress waits for no one.

140
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,000
So now you'rean expert
on the bank thief, as weII.

141
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,000
Give us the benefit
of your ineffabIe wisdom, Fogg.

142
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,700
26 minutes ago,
a ship Ieft Dover for Paris.

143
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,600
From there, the thief takes
the Orient Express, where he transfers...

144
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,000
to a steamer from IstanbuI to India.
In IittIeover a month,

145
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,600
that man couId be in China.
- If we're to beIieve Fogg's caIcuIations,

146
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,100
he wiII havecircIed the gIobe
and returned to EngIand in a fortnight.

147
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,300
ActuaIIy, by my caIcuIations,
it wouId becIoser to exactIy...

148
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
80days.

149
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
Outstanding idea.

150
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
WeII then, Fogg,
Iet's see you circumnavigate the worId...

151
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,700
in 80days.

152
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
That wouId bea fruitIess use
of my time.

153
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
I'm on the vergeof numerous...

154
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,500
countIess scientific breakthroughs.
- You coward. Admit it.

155
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,100
It cannot bedone.
- It can! I couId do it.

156
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,900
A wager. 10,000 pounds.

157
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,700
UnIike you and your coIIeagues,
money does not inspire me.

158
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,300
I beIieve every man has his price.

159
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Even you, oh nobIe PhiIeas Fogg.

160
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,900
There must besomething I couId offer you
that wouId be worthy of your time.

161
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,600
There is. Your position
as head of the RoyaI Academy.

162
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
With the Queen's ear, I couId Iead Britain
and the rest of the worId...

163
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,100
into a new ageof progress and discovery.

164
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,700
Fair enough.
- What?

165
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,500
I, Lord KeIvin, hereby vow...

166
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,200
to surrender my position as Minister
of Science to PhiIeas Fogg...

167
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,600
if hecan circumnavigate the gIobe...

168
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,500
in no more than 80days.

169
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,700
But if hecannot,

170
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
he must never set foot
in this Academy again.

171
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,100
He must tear down
that abhorrent eyesore...

172
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
hecaIIs a Iaboratory,
and he must swear...

173
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,900
never to invent again.

174
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,100
Just as I aIways suspected, Fogg.

175
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,100
You promiseso much,
yet you deIiver nothing.

176
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
I'II take the wager.
- What did you say?

177
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,600
I'II take your wager!

178
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,200
He'II take it?

179
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,100
Then it's done. A man who has never
set foot out of EngIand...

180
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,700
circIingthe gIobe.
This is gettingto be rather amusing.

181
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,500
History won't remember your amusements,
Lord KeIvin.

182
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,500
But it wiII be hard-pressed
to forget the moment...

183
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
I'm standingon the very topstep
of the RoyaI Academy of Science...

184
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,100
by thestrikeof noon, after I,
PhiIeas Fogg,

185
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:16,100
have traveIed around the worId
in 80days!

186
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,700
Oh, dear.

187
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,700
Mr Fogg, we'reaII packed
and ready to go. Mr Fogg?

188
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,300
Are you in here?

189
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,300
Mr Fogg, are you weII, sir?

190
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,800
Passepartout.

191
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,100
WouId you sit with mea moment?

192
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,300
Yes, sir.

193
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,900
I've risked everything.
My entire Iife's work.

194
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
For something you beIieve in.

195
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,100
NothingcouId make moresense
than that, sir.

196
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
You'rean honorabIe man, Passepartout.

197
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,000
But I'm afraid
this was a caIamitous Iapseof judgment.

198
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,100
Mr Fogg?
- Yes?

199
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,000
Maybe weshouId Iet your famiIy...
- There is no one Ieft to teII.

200
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,700
This houseand my inventions
areaII I have.

201
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,000
And a brave new French vaIet
that wiII heIp you make it...

202
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,500
around the worId in 80days.

203
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,900
You reaIIy beIieve wecan succeed?
- Yes.

204
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Yes! Yes! Yes!

205
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,400
You're mad. We'II besIiced to pieces
before we reach India.

206
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,200
HaIt!

207
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,100
Quitea contraption you got here.
- Why, thank you, Inspector.

208
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,100
But I'm afraid I'm goingto have to detain
you and your vaIet untiI further notice.

209
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,500
See, this new doohickey
is in vioIation of thecity's new...

210
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,900
vehicIecode.
- VehicIecode?

211
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,000
Code 431: ''AII vehicIes
must be powered by horses...

212
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,500
or other indigenous quadruped creatures
of the Iike.

213
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,500
ExcIuding giraffes and...''
- My good man, you'redriveIing.

214
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Now, stand aside. I'm about to embark
on a journey around the worId.

215
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,500
Not in this monstrosity, you're not. No!
- That's hot.

216
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,700
It's not. Ah!

217
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,600
Time to go. We havea boat to catch.
- SteaIinga poIice vehicIe is not...

218
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,600
an acceptabIe way to begin our journey.
- Not steaIing. Borrowing.

219
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Excuse us. We're just borrowing
this vehicIe to catch our ship to Paris.

220
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,000
If someonecouId inform
theappropriateauthorities.

221
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:28,100
BIoody heII! My brain's Ieakin'!

222
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:35,300
Damn that nincompoop Fix. What's the point
of hiringa corrupt poIiceofficer...

223
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,600
if hecan't even abuse the Iaw properIy?
Kitchner!

224
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,400
TeII Inspector Fix to pack his bags.
He's goingon a IittIe trip.

225
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Retrieve the Jade Buddha in Paris.

226
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,500
As for Lau Xing... kiII him!

227
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,700
Smart man.
- Passepartout, wiII you teII...

228
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,600
this impudent feIIow that we must Ieave
within 6 1/2 hours, or we wiII miss...

229
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
our connection in ConstantinopIe.
- Yes, sir. PIease, we're in a hurry.

230
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:46,500
Passepartout? In French.

231
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,900
Sacre bIeu Ia champagno château brion
Francois à Ia oh Ia Ia foiede gras.

232
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
You imbeciIe.

233
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,900
What did hesay?
- Hesaid...

234
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,600
What?
- Hesays not to worry.

235
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
The next train wiII Ieave in five hours.
Good time for sightseeing!

236
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,900
This is a scientific expedition,
not a hoIiday!

237
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,500
I wiII not miss this train.

238
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,900
Ah. Very amazing.
- What? What does it say?

239
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
This week onIy, Eddie Thomason
wiII beshowing his new inventions.

240
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,100
Thomas Edison? Here in Paris?
- A chance to meet another great inventor.

241
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,100
I wouId quite Iike to teII him about my
''whistIe'' modification. - Good idea.

242
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,600
See? An exhibition. Science!

243
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,000
I assure you,
theseare not the works of Thomas Edison.

244
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I think he's somewherearound here.

245
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,600
Wait a moment. This isn't science!

246
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,300
This is art!
- Yeah.

247
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,400
That painting is highIy inaccurate.
- It's not supposed to be ''accurate''.

248
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,700
Theartist views reaIity
through imagination,

249
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,700
rather than simpIy recording it.

250
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,500
It is caIIed Impressionism.

251
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:38,000
WeII... I'm not ''impressed''.

252
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,400
Trees aren't vioIet,
grass is not charcoaI,

253
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,900
and a man cannot...

254
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,800
fIy.

255
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,300
You feeI something. You dream of fIying.

256
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,800
Or of naked men?

257
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,000
Sometimes.

258
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
The fIying. Not the men.

259
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,500
I'm gIad you Iike my painting.
Monique Larouche. - PhiIeas Fogg.

260
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,600
WeII, it's an awfuI Iot better
than theseamateurs.

261
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
What did hesay?

262
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,700
Oh no...

263
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,500
Oh no, not again.

264
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,100
Who is responsibIe
for this vandaIism?

265
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,000
It's mine, sir. Does it pIease you?
- PIease me?

266
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,500
You want to hangsomething?
Go hang peopIe's coats...

267
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,100
as you were hired to do!
- But, sir...

268
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,100
In fact, don't!
You're fired!

269
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Leaveart to theartist.

270
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,200
Goodness. What was aII that about?

271
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,600
A weaIthy gentIeman bought my painting
for a Iot of money.

272
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,600
Champagne for everyone!

273
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,900
I'm stiII Iookingfor Mr Eddie.
Nice painting.

274
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,000
Have you ever considered a career
in schematic drawing?

275
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,600
No. It wouId be far too Iimiting.

276
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,700
At Ieast your work
shows genuine promise.

277
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
Thank you.

278
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,500
Because I painted many months
when I was Iacking inspira...

279
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:37,100
I found some men
to heIp me find Mr Eddiman.

280
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,300
This way!
- Thank you! Thank you.

281
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,400
He's very eager.

282
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:58,200
No, no, no. It's terribIe, no?

283
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,200
No. It's... cIever.

284
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,100
Yes. He's a cIown.

285
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:08,100
And yet, he's incredibIy angry.

286
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,100
The irony's terrifying.

287
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,700
Is that good?
- Is it?

288
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,600
This is interesting.
But you reaIize without opposabIe thumbs,

289
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,700
a dogcouId never pIay poker.
- Yes, they can.

290
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,700
Now, where have you ever seen a dog
pIaying poker? - Right there.

291
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:29,500
Perhaps I'm not the best judge.

292
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
Bandits! They came to takeaway
aII the paintings!

293
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,100
Look out, my paintings!

294
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,400
QuickIy! Come this way!
- Passepartout!

295
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,300
Go, go, go!

296
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Thank you, Miss Larouche. You may just
havesaved our trip. - There you are.

297
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,500
I wouId Iike to repay you.
- Then take me with you.

298
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,100
What?
- I'm stifIed here.

299
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,500
PigeonhoIed. They think of me
onIy as a coat check girI!

300
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,600
Why?
- Because I am thecoat check girI.

301
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:35,100
Ah.
- Look... the Ieadingart critic in Paris.

302
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,700
Look what he wrote
about oneof my paintings.

303
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,500
I can't read this. I think it's French.
- I wish I couIdn't.

304
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,500
Why do you carry it around with you?
- So when I do succeed,

305
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:51,100
I can throw it in his face.
But for now, I need a worId journey...

306
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,700
to inspire me.

307
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,600
I'm inspired
to get us back on scheduIe.

308
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,300
Let's see. Wind veIocity,
approximateIy 12 knots.

309
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Factoring in air density... outstanding!

310
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,900
Passepartout! Onward! Ah.

311
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,700
There we go.
TeII him to keep thechange.

312
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,700
Ah, Pierre, paté, fromage, Papuan.
- We're goingaround the worId in 80days!

313
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,100
My God! They are mad!

314
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:35,100
PIease, Miss Larouche. The baIIoon
cannot support aII this weight.

315
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,500
Your hot air shouId compensate, no?
- Get off! Let go!

316
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,100
What are they doing?
- They're beingdisorderIy.

317
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,500
Hey! Let go! Let go!
- Hey! Passepartout, my vaIise!

318
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,100
It has aII my money in it!

319
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,000
Hey, Iady! Lady! It's my bag!
- No, that is my bag!

320
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,600
That's not your bag. It's my bag.
- No!

321
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,200
You'recrazy.
- Yes.

322
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
That tickIes.

323
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,600
He took my bag.
- Mr Fogg!

324
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
Good catch!
- Thank you!

325
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,900
Thoseare the gaIIery bandits!

326
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,900
Oh, yes!

327
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,900
HestoIe my purse!
ThescoundreI stoIe my purse!

328
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,600
My bag!

329
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,600
We'vestoIen that oId Iady's purse.

330
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:48,500
We must heIp Passepartout!
How do I make this go Iower?

331
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,500
What are you doing?
DecreasingtheoveraII weight won't work.

332
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,700
Yes, it wiII!

333
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,700
Physics, no?
- Yes.

334
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,000
Hai! Ooowww...

335
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,100
Bonjour!

336
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,400
Bonjour!

337
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Bye-bye!

338
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,300
Wake up... Wake up, Iady!

339
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,300
Wake up, Iady! Wake up!

340
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,500
Bye, Mama. Bye, baby.
- Miss.

341
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,700
Very impressive! I'd have Iet go by now.

342
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:27,100
Thestatue's grabbing his trousers!
- I don't think it's doing it on purpose.

343
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,500
Oh, dear.

344
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,700
WeII done. We'restiII on scheduIe
despite thosedogged thieves.

345
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,800
Yes, yes. Thank you.

346
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,700
Those ''art thieves''
seemed to recognize you.

347
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,700
I Iook Iikesomeone they know.
- Someother ''Frenchman'', perhaps?

348
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,900
So wherecan wedrop you off?

349
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,600
We're not stopping. Once we Iand in Munich
to board the Orient Express,

350
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,600
you are free to go.
- Thank you so much.

351
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,600
For what?
- For saying I'm free to go with you.

352
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,600
I did not say you were free to come,
I said you were free to go.

353
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Where?
- Anywhere.

354
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Yes. Thank you. I wiII go with you.
- No, you wiII not, Miss Larouche.

355
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Monique.
- Miss...

356
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
Monique!
- Monique!

357
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
There. Now weare gettingaIong.

358
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,100
Look at thesunrise.
There is onIy one word for it: magicaI.

359
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Miss Larouche! I refuse to aIIow you
to continue traveIingwith us.

360
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,300
I'm not traveIingwith you.
I'm making my own way.

361
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,500
Maybe you shouIdn't traveI with me.
- This is what happens...

362
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,100
when you Ieave your home.
You meet... peopIe!

363
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:32,700
Why are you keeping up this ruse?

364
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,900
Perhaps I'II inform Mr Fogg,

365
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,100
and heand I can specuIate together.

366
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,900
A very sacred object
was stoIen from my viIIage.

367
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,600
I have taken it back.

368
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,400
How incroyabIe!
- For many centuries,

369
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,700
the Jade Buddha has protected my peopIe.
It has never Ieft our viIIage...

370
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,500
untiI now.

371
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,100
Those ''art thieves'', who are they?

372
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,500
The BIack Scorpions.
They work for an eviI warIord, Fang.

373
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,500
She wants the Buddha,
so shecan takeover my viIIage.

374
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,300
I must return the Jade Buddha
to protect Lanzhou.

375
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,000
Mr Fogg is the fastest way.

376
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
Perhaps, then, wecan heIponeanother.

377
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,100
I wiII keep your secret. And you,
you convince Mr Foggto aIIow me...

378
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:48,000
to traveI the worId with you.

379
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,500
Keep zis dumkopf in his seat,
or we throw him off!

380
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,700
MereIy pointingout
that if they coordinated...

381
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,000
their coaI shoveIingtechnique,
they couId maximizeour speed.

382
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,000
When we reach ConstantinopIe,
I suggest you board a train...

383
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,900
weare not on.
- Mr Fogg, she must come with us.

384
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,400
And why is that?
- We just discovered...

385
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,100
that weare reIated from thesame famiIy.

386
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm her father's second cousin's sister
on my mother's side.

387
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,900
French.

388
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,200
Monsieur Fogg, if I make the train
go faster, can I come with you?

389
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
Yes.

390
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,900
I bid you fareweII, Miss Larouche.

391
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,100
If there's anything eIse you'd Iike,
just Iet us know.

392
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,100
Ah, voiIà!
Champagne with your First CIass seats,

393
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,900
MademoiseIIe Larouche.
- Merci.

394
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,700
Champagne?
- No, thank you.

395
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,600
Merci.
- Monsieur.

396
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,200
A tea?

397
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Okay!

398
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,800
''How to make EngIish tea.''

399
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,200
''PreciseIy 96 degrees...''

400
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,700
Excuse me, sir.

401
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,600
Fogg's vaIet! The Jade Buddha!

402
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:15,100
It is not a Jade Buddha.
- Yes, it is!

403
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,900
You're right. But I am not a vaIet.
- Oh, reaIIy?

404
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,600
My nose... bIoody nose!
Let me in!

405
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,700
You're gonna pay for scorchin' my wiIIy!

406
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,500
Now I've got you!

407
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,000
You're under arrest!

408
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
Sorry!

409
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,000
Why thedeviI are westopping?

410
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Prince Hapi wouId be honored to have
Mr Foggand his traveIingcompanions...

411
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
at his banquet.
- How very fIattering.

412
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,000
But pIease inform Prince Hapi
we'reon a very tight scheduIe.

413
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:41,700
Prince Hapi demands it.
- Then Prince Hapi...

414
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,400
wiII have to get accustomed
to not getting everything he wants.

415
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,500
It is magnificent!
- Mister Fogg, his house is even bigger...

416
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,100
than yours.
- His coIIection! His taste!

417
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
It's exquisite!
- Yes, it is.

418
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,900
Not good. No. Look. Broken.

419
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,500
And where is his Highness?

420
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,100
The prince is aIso a taIented musician.
- I can assure you, if I did nothing...

421
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,500
but Ioungeabout the paIaceaII day,
I'd Iearn to pIuck a few notes.

422
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,500
Let's make this brief. I wiII pose
for a few photographs, perhaps wearing...

423
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,600
a turban, hoIdingan atIas...
- MademoiseIIe.

424
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:52,600
How magicaI that our paths shouId cross.
Do you beIieve in fate?

425
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,000
If that's what you caII it
when onestops a movingtrain...

426
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,500
and kidnaps its passengers.
- PhiIeas Fogg. PIease forgive me,

427
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,500
but I feeI Iike Aphrodite herseIf
descended to earth.

428
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,000
How does a ravishingwoman Iike you...

429
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:13,300
I never think when I'm naked.
- I do. In the bath.

430
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yes, weII, it's...
- No! Don't touch it!

431
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,800
That is my most treasured possession.

432
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,100
I was onIy pointing.
- Don't even point.

433
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,800
Rodin.
- Yes.

434
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,600
A Rodin.
- Oh.

435
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,900
I've never seen a more beautifuI...
muscuIar form.

436
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,900
I can assure you,
I'm in much better shape now.

437
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,700
IncroyabIe! It's a scuIptureof you!
- Yes.

438
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,000
''Happy Birthday. Your paI, Rodin.''
- Come, my dear.

439
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,700
Let us dine.
- Yes.

440
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,000
Mr Fogg, pIease join us.
- Sorry. Weareon a very tight scheduIe.

441
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,600
We wiII join you, actuaIIy.
But just onedrink.

442
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,600
After the Dukeand the Duchess
sat down in the bath, I reaIized...

443
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
I forgot to put on my bathingsuit.

444
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,100
I'm such a fooI,
aIways embarrassing myseIf...

445
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:25,100
in front of visitingdignitaries.
But you know how that can be, right, PhiI?

446
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100
Uh, yes.

447
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,100
It's ''PhiIeas'', actuaIIy.
- So, Foggy,

448
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,500
I heard you'rean inventor.
- I try to think of new ways...

449
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,100
to better mankind,
if that's what you mean.

450
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,600
I'm not an inventor, but I did deveIop
a new way of irrigatingdry Iand,

451
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:47,000
so that no one in my kingdom
ever has to be hungry.

452
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Mr Fogg invented ''wheeIieshoes''.

453
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,900
Not now, Passepartout.

454
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,500
Oh. Mmm.

455
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Miss Larouche?
- Mmm?

456
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,000
It is mesmerizing
the way your face iIIuminates.

457
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,300
Her discoIoration couId be
an aIIergic reaction...

458
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,900
or a miId form of hives.

459
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,500
AIthough I've noticed a certain gIow
about her compIexion...

460
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,800
when she's drawing.

461
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,200
And sometimes when she's concentrating
on her Iatest work...

462
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,100
her ears wiII actuaIIy fIutter.

463
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,500
It's rather fetching.
- WeII, guess who eIse was in this bath?

464
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,800
U.S. President Rutherford B Hayes.

465
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:45,500
ShouIdn't we be going now?
We havea scheduIe to keep.

466
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,100
Thank you for your hospitaIity.
- It's been absoIuteIy fascinating,

467
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,100
but I'm afraid we must push on.
- The gentIemen are free to go.

468
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,500
But Miss Larouchestays here with me
to be my wife.

469
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Yes. Wife number seven.

470
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,700
You haveseven wives?
- One for each day of the week.

471
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,500
This is absoIuteIy ridicuIous.
- No more taIk!

472
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,100
Prince Hapi has spoken.

473
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,500
WeII, wedid say ''onedrink''.
Passepartout, we're Ieaving.

474
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,100
I can teII when we're not wanted.

475
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,600
Monsieur Fogg!

476
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,600
WiII Tuesdays work for you?
- Goodbye!

477
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,400
Thank you!

478
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,500
No!

479
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,700
HaIt! Or Hapi gets smashed!

480
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,300
PIease! Anything but my statueof me!

481
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:51,600
Miss Larouche, pIease join us.

482
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,100
AII of you, drop your weapons.
- Do as hesays!

483
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,600
Get in the tent.
- Everybody!

484
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,200
Let's go! Comeon!

485
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,600
Now, takeoff your cIothes and...

486
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:17,600
I assure you thestatue is not armed...
harmed, in any way. In fact,

487
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,200
it's compIeteIy...

488
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,900
Get them!

489
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,900
His arm!

490
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,600
Thank you, PhiIeas. That was very heroic.
- Yes, and needIessIy time-consuming.

491
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:50,000
This is exactIy why I shouId never
have Iet you comeaIong.

492
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:53,500
KiII them! I want my arm back!

493
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
No!

494
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:02,300
Sir, I've received a teIegram
from Inspector Fix.

495
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:07,100
Accordingto him, the bank thief
and Fogg's vaIet are thesame man.

496
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:11,100
That numbskuII Foggdoesn't even reaIize
he's transportingthe bank thief.

497
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,300
Or does he?
Hedid Ieave town in quitea hurry,

498
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,500
wouIdn't you say, Lord Rhodes?
- Indeed, Lord SaIisbury.

499
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:22,300
Evadingarrest
and steaIinga poIice vehicIe...

500
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,500
sounds rather incriminatingto me.
- Onecan aImost deduce...

501
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:31,000
this entire bet was mereIy a ruse
to faciIitate his escape.

502
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,000
Don't you agree, Lord KeIvin?
- Yes. BriIIiant, Lord SaIisbury!

503
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:41,000
I shaII namea beef-reIated entrée
after you. Kitchner?

504
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Inform your men in ScotIand Yard
that PhiIeas Fogg is without a doubt...

505
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,000
the man who robbed the Bank of EngIand!
Whereare they now?

506
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,000
They're takinga train across India,
from Bombay to CaIcutta.

507
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,000
Thank God weown India.
- I want their faces posted...

508
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:01,600
in every poIicestation, army barracks,
post office, raiIway station...

509
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,100
and outhouse in India. We're going
to stop Foggand get my Jade Buddha back

510
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,100
by any means necessary!

511
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,100
Agra is where we wiII capture them.

512
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Intercept them at Agra.
Carry on, CoIoneI!

513
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,600
AIright, faII in!

514
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,500
FaII in, on thedoubIe!

515
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,400
And they were the greatest Kung Fu boxers,
the Ten Tigers of Canton.

516
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,700
Brothers in arms,
they fought to keeporder...

517
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,000
and justice in China. The famous
of the Ten Tigers is Wong Fei Hung.

518
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,700
It's saIivatingon these.
Is this your goat?

519
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,300
Did they reaIIy fight Iike tigers?
- Each tiger had his own...

520
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
animaI fightingstyIe.
The tiger!

521
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,700
Snake!

522
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:22,300
Whereare my steam pressurecaIcuIations?
The goat!

523
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,600
Passepartout, I'm beingattacked
by a ferocious animaI! SmeII the hooves.

524
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,000
Sorry, Mr Fogg.
- PIease keep that inconsiderate beast...

525
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,000
away from me. And refrain
from your ridicuIous anecdotes.

526
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Why do you not Iike his story, Mr Frog?
- It's Fogg. PhiIeas Fogg.

527
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,000
How can man Iearn to defend himseIf
by watchinganimaIs...

528
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,900
behave Iike... animaIs?
- It is a famous Iegend.

529
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,600
A ridicuIous Iegend.

530
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Most Iegends are born from truth.

531
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,600
Yes, but aII truths are born from facts.
SoIid, tangibIe facts...

532
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,900
that can becaIcuIated
and written down on paper.

533
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,500
And then eaten by a goat.

534
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,500
Mister FeeIsiIIious,
when I teII thestory of the man...

535
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,500
who circIed the entire worId in 80days,
wouId that not bea Iegend?

536
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,100
OnIy if the man's name
was ''FeeIsiIIious Frog''.

537
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,500
What the bIazes is it now?

538
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,100
Get back inside! Comeon! Good...

539
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:33,100
Find these men!
- Uh, oh.

540
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,500
Time to go. They seem to think
we robbed the Bank of EngIand.

541
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:42,100
Preposterous! This is mereIy an attempt
by Lord KeIvin to impede my journey.

542
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,300
I am a British citizen.
I have nothingto fear.

543
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,400
Except buIIets.

544
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,400
Seen these men?

545
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:09,600
Any word on the bank thieves, sir?
- They werespotted on the train.

546
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,700
Keep your rifIes at the ready.
- They won't get past us, sir!

547
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,900
Ladies, have you seen these two men?
Look cIoseIy.

548
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,600
They're very dangerous.

549
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,000
They're everywhere!
This is not goingto work. Stay caIm.

550
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,600
Just act Iike Iadies.
- Not a probIem.

551
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,100
It'II never work. I feeI faint.
- PhiIeas, women are not that weak.

552
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:37,700
No, but I am.

553
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:46,300
HeIIo, darIing. What can I do for you?

554
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,200
Wait a minute! Oh!

555
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,900
What are you doing?
This is no time to sIeep. - Stop!

556
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:11,600
Go, go, go!
Get us out of Agra quickIy!

557
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:15,500
Passepartout, wedid it!

558
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,200
Hey! Wrongway!

559
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,200
PhiIeas! No!

560
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,600
Run, Passepartout!

561
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:42,300
Fogg's vaIet! I have him!
- What are you doing?

562
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,100
Now I've got you!
Hand over the Jade Buddha.

563
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,500
HeIp! You're under arrest!

564
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,900
Watch my pIums!

565
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:00,700
See? Now you made him very mad!
Let's go!

566
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:04,700
Stopor I'II arrest you as weII!

567
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,400
Run!

568
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,800
Which way?
- Down!

569
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,400
Not yet!

570
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,000
Jump!

571
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,300
Go, go, go!
- What's upsetting him?

572
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:35,300
HeaIso wants the Jade Buddha!
- Then give it to him!

573
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,300
PhiIeas, wake up!
- PIease, pIease, you must go.

574
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,400
My husband wiII be homesoon.
- PhiIeas.

575
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,300
PhiIeas! HeIp!
- Fear not! I'II protect you!

576
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm here, my dear.
That stumbIe was simpIy to buy me time.

577
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,100
This cane is not what it appears.

578
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,900
If I press this button,
it wiII depIoy a weapon...

579
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,500
far deadIier than yours.

580
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,900
This is... a strange knife.

581
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:35,700
Isn't it a sextant?

582
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,700
Yes.

583
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,500
Are you aIright, my dear?
- PhiIeas, it was so enIightening.

584
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,300
You'd better put this on.

585
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,500
Perhaps I shouId wear
women's cIothing moreoften.

586
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:09,600
WeshouId run.
- What, now?

587
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:13,900
Yes, weshouId run.

588
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,300
Break down thedoor!
- Ok!

589
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,900
No, no! Not on my brains!

590
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,800
Give me that Jade Budd-air!
- Ok. What's a Budd-air?

591
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:43,900
Get ready to jump! Now!

592
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,000
It is him! The EngIishman who robbed
the Bank of EngIand!

593
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,600
He's escaping in that paIki-gharrie!

594
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,600
They'II check aII trains heading east.

595
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,600
Even if we make it to thecoast,
wecan't saiI into Singapore...

596
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,900
or even Hong Kong.
They're both British coIonies.

597
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Does EngIand own everything in Asia?
- Not China. Not yet.

598
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,400
Passepartout?

599
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,800
You Iook troubIed.
- I cannot keep Iyingto Mr Fogg.

600
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:22,000
You did what you had to.
The fateof your viIIage...

601
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,000
is of far greater importance
than any bet PhiIeas has made.

602
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,000
If he Ioses, aII it wiII cost him
is some money and pride.

603
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,700
No.
Mr FoggwiII Iose much more than that.

604
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:36,700
What do you mean?

605
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:43,500
My viIIage!

606
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:48,700
Your viIIage?

607
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:52,100
I mean... ''My, what a viIIage!''
- Oh, it's beautifuI!

608
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,200
Wedo need to stopand re-suppIy,
but we must beoff by morning.

609
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,800
Ah, Lau Xing.

610
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:25,300
Lau Xing.
- Lau Xing.

611
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,800
Lau Xing, you have returned!

612
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:36,200
Goodness, that's quitea weIcome.
Do these peopIe know him?

613
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:41,700
It must be their custom, the way
they weIcomeaII strangers. Lau Xing!

614
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,500
Lau Xing!

615
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,100
ChiIdren, pIease give my friends
thesame greeting.

616
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,400
My son, you are home!

617
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,000
Lau Xing.

618
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,300
Lau Xing!

619
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,200
Who is that man?

620
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,100
He's my vaIet.
- I am so proud of you.

621
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,100
My son has a vaIet!
How happy I am!

622
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:35,300
We must ceIebrate
that Lau Xing has returned.

623
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:39,600
His vaIet wiII cook
a bigfeast for us.

624
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,100
Oh, it's beautifuI.
You are very taIented.

625
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:53,500
Thank you.
You need more bIue.

626
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,300
Fascinating. AbsoIuteIy fascinating.

627
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,900
Sorry?

628
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,700
ViIe.

629
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,200
AbsoIuteIy viIe.

630
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,300
WeIcome home, Lau Xing.

631
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,500
Your brothers wiII be proud.

632
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,900
The whoIe notion of a
Iighter-than-air craft cannot work,

633
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,500
unIess you can harness the power of heIium
or hydrogen, which...

634
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:50,300
Yes, weII,
I couIdn't have put it better myseIf.

635
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:55,100
Is theassociation with
the EngIishman wise? - He's the most...

636
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:58,200
discipIined man I've ever met.

637
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,600
Thecrane!

638
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,400
The monkey! Oh, thank you.

639
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,200
Thesnake!

640
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,500
And of course, the eagIe!

641
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,000
PhiIeas?

642
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,300
PhiIeas, I made this for you.
- Oh, yes.

643
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,400
Oh, that's very, very good. Yes.
What does this say?

644
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,200
''Stupid.''

645
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,600
You have returned
our sacred Buddha.

646
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,700
It has brought hope
back to our viIIage.

647
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,400
Drink!

648
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,600
Thanks to your courageous efforts...
- Drink!

649
01:02:56,900 --> 01:03:00,800
I beIieve I've had quite enough.
I'm just... I'm just... I've...

650
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:06,600
Thanks to your courageous efforts...
We wiII Iive in peaceand...

651
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,400
Drink!

652
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:17,700
Thanks to your courageous efforts...
We wiII Iive in peaceand harmony.

653
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,100
And for that weare eternaIIy gratefuI!
Drink!

654
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,600
I'm goingto beabominabIy iII.

655
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:47,300
I... I want to die.

656
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,700
PIease kiII me.

657
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,700
''Dear Father,
I wiII find the fastest way to China.''

658
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:44,200
Mr Fogg, I was goingto teII you.

659
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:52,300
This is your famiIy.
- My name's not Passepartout.

660
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:56,100
It's Lau Xing.
I robbed the Bank of EngIand.

661
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,000
You robbed the Bank of EngIand?
- Not for goId or money,

662
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:06,500
but for the Jade Buddha.
It was stoIen from our viIIage.

663
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,500
He had no other choice.
This was his onIy way to get home.

664
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,900
You knew about this?
- WeII...

665
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,700
I have nothing
but respect for you, Mr Fogg.

666
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,000
Then respect my deductive reasoning.
You have both used me,

667
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,000
you to escape to China,
and you to traveI the worId...

668
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:35,600
to further your Impressionistic humbug.

669
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:39,900
Your overtures of comradeship
or friendshipor...

670
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,000
AII of it was just a means
to ensure I wouId take you aIong.

671
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,600
My entire Iife, I got aIongspIendidIy
by myseIf. You've been nothing more...

672
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:56,600
than pebbIes in my shoes, sIowing medown,
endangering my Iife! AII of it was just...

673
01:05:56,600 --> 01:06:00,600
a means to ensure I wouId take you aIong.
Risking everything I've ever Iived for!

674
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,400
And you...

675
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,300
You knew that.

676
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,300
Don't Iet him go.
He'II be Iost by midnight. Go!

677
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,200
Moreof your reIatives, I suppose.

678
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,000
You can just forget about a reference.

679
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:41,600
I bega thousand pardons, Mr Fogg.

680
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:53,500
What's hescreamingabout?
- He is saying ''PIease Iet me go.

681
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,700
I am bored.''

682
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:00,900
Why is he imprisoned?

683
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,200
Urinating in pubIic.
- Charming.

684
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,600
At Ieast he had thedecency to be
forthcomingabout it. Is thereanything...

685
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:19,500
you've toId me that's even remoteIy true?
- I reaIIy can sing.

686
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Frère Jacques, frère Jacques,

687
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
dormez-vous, dormez-vous?

688
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Sonnez Ies matines, sonnez Ies matines,

689
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,400
ding, ding, ding. Ding, ding, ding.
- Ding, dang, dong, Passepartout.

690
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,300
Ding, dang, dong. Look!

691
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,400
Oh, good. Herecomes Mister Grumpy
and the Leatherettes.

692
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:52,800
Where is the Jade Buddha?
- You are better off kiIIing me.

693
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,300
You have nerve.
But are your comrades so brave?

694
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,700
Your threats don't frighten me.
Nor does your siIIy braceIet.

695
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:07,700
AIright. It's not siIIy.
- I spit on you!

696
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,700
Francespits on you! Vive Lanzhou!

697
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:17,100
Your turn wiII comesoon enough.
- Coward! Leave them aIone.

698
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:21,000
Fight me.
- Yes. Fight him.

699
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,200
Let's see how ferocious you reaIIy are.

700
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:13,700
Hey, that's cheating!

701
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,600
Look out! There!

702
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,300
Behind you!

703
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,600
No! Take them!

704
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,900
SiIence!

705
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,000
You savages!

706
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,100
PhiIeas, heIp him!
- Watch out on the right!

707
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,100
No, my right.
- Stop heIping me!

708
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:50,300
Sorry.
- What's happening? Where is Passepartout?

709
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,500
How is he gettingon?
- I wouIdn't say he's winning,

710
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:58,100
but I think he's doingaIright.

711
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,800
Go home to Mama.

712
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,600
What took you so Iong?
- I had to finish my Iunch.

713
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:40,100
Wong Fei Hung. SureIy you are not
fooIish enough to takeon...

714
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:43,300
aII my men by yourseIf.

715
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:49,800
Ten Tigers!

716
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,800
KiII them!

717
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,100
Execute the prisoners!
I want their heads on pikes!

718
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,300
What time is it, PhiIeas?

719
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,700
Passepartout... knife!

720
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,300
Merci.
- You're weIcome.

721
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:14,600
Promise me the BIack Scorpions
wiII never come back to Lanzhou.

722
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,900
Theseare my brothers and sisters:
The Ten Tigers.

723
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,600
But thereareonIy nine.
- IncIuding me.

724
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,600
They're reaI. The Iegend was true.

725
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,500
Mr Fogg...
- Passepartout, or whatever your name is,

726
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,500
save your apoIogies.
- PhiIeas, he risked his Iife...

727
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,500
for what he beIieves in.
If anyone understands that, you do.

728
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:46,100
PIease ensure Miss Larouche
gets homesafeIy.

729
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:49,900
This shouId beadequate.

730
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:55,900
Oh... I... beIieve this is your veiI.

731
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,100
I wiII never dress Iikea woman again.

732
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,700
Ever.
- Mr Fogg...

733
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:11,100
PIease Iet me heIp you win your bet.

734

I havesecured theservices
of a more reIiabIe gentIeman.

735
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,100
Give mea minute.

736
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:30,300
Yes, weII,
perhaps I'II just... traveI aIone.

737
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:34,300
Ah. The most modern city in the worId.

738
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,500
FinaIIy... civiIization.

739
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,700
Excuse me? Pardon me?
Can anyonedirect me...

740
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,600

741
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:57,500
I'm so sorry, sir.
I'm such a rutabaga sometimes.

742
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:02,500
Oh, no, no. PIease.
It's my fauIt entireIy. Let me...

743

Oh Lord, I think I sprained my knee.

744
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:12,500
I shouId find you a physician.
- There's a kind oId doctor...

745
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,900
who has an office just around thecorner.
- ExceIIent. I'II get him for you. Yes.

746
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,800
Thank you. ThereshouId be more peopIe
Iike you in this worId.

747
01:17:24,700 --> 01:17:27,300
Woo-doggie! Jackpot!

748
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,000
Mon Dieu! Can you imagine PhiIeas aIone
in a pIace Iike this?

749
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,600
I'm sure he's fine.

750
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,000
AIms.

751
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,900
AIms.

752
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,200
AIms for the poor.

753
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,100
Arms? You aIready got arms.

754
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,400
It's money you need.
- I can't even scrounge proficientIy.

755
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,600
Hey, cheer up, paI.

756
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:18,000
You've just got to figureout
what'II work for you.

757
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:21,600
What makes you different from them?

758
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,200
I am hungry and miserabIe.
- No.

759
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,500
You stink. Now, your stink
is your most powerfuI weapon...

760
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:33,400
in your beggingarsenaI. Watch this.

761
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:40,100
Hey! Give mesome money, pIease.
- Sure, feIIa. Just don't touch me.

762
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,100
You stink!
That guy smeIIs Iikea dead horse!

763
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:47,300
I'm not proud of it.
It's simpIe, yet effective.

764
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:51,300
I see.
- You try. Go on. I've got faith in you.

765
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:54,900
Excuse me.

766
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,700
I'm not gonna Iie to you.
That's gonna happen about haIf the time.

767
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:09,900
Here. It's a voIume business.

768
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:14,300
Hunk of cheese?
- Oh, yes. I wouId rather...

769
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,100
Maybe Iater.

770
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:21,100
What are thosedrawings?
You'resome kind of deviI worshipper?

771
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,300
Don't you be puttinga hex on me!
I'II cut you!

772
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,100
I'm an inventor.
- That's nice.

773
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,700
Or rather, I was.

774
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:42,300
And oneday I wiII buiId a machine
that wiII aIIow men to fIy.

775
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,000
FIying men? Where?

776
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Nowhere.

777
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,300
Whereare the fIying men?
- They'reover there.

778
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,400
The birdmen arecoming!
Hey, Louie! The birdmen arecoming!

779
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,200
The bird... birdmen!
Birdmen! Bird...

780
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,700
''I traveIed the worId for inspiration
and found it in a man...

781
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:18,700
who Iives what hedreams.''

782
01:20:56,700 --> 01:20:59,300
PhiIeas?
- Fogg!

783
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,500
Passepartout! Monique!

784
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:07,700
Mr Fogg!

785
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:11,600
You crossed the Pacific Ocean...
for me?

786
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,100
We wiII heIp you win your bet.
- Mr Fogg, I wiII never Iet you down.

787
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:20,500
Why wouId you do this?
- Because you areour friend.

788
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:23,700
And perhaps more.

789
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,100
More with her. You and me,
we just stay good friends.

790
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:32,600
Oh!

791
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,400
Lord KeIvin, I can offer you
something much more precious...

792
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:40,100
than a singIe Jade Buddha.
Beneath Lanzhou...

793
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:45,000
area series of untapped Jade reserves.
If the town were to beoverrun,

794
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:48,100
those reserves wouId beours.
- I see.

795
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:54,100
However, shouId PhiIeas Foggwin
this race, I'II have neither the power...

796
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,100
nor the means to hand over any arsenaI.

797
01:21:57,100 --> 01:22:01,500
Then I wiII see to it personaIIy
that Mr Fogg's journey is cut short.

798
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,900
Very weII.
Let us consider our deaI to be...

799
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,000
StiII, it's a first-rate idea, sir.
- What's this thing here,

800
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,600
bIocking my Jade reserves?
That wiII certainIy have to bedemoIished.

801
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,800
But that is the Great WaII of China, sir.

802
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,800
It's not that great.

803
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,700
Passepartout went to get heIp hours ago.

804
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,700
What if he's Iost or...
- Don't fret, my dear.

805
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,600
Passepartout's a keen warrior
with impeccabIesurvivaI instincts.

806
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,600
I have no doubt he wiII return with heIp,
and we wiII board our train in Reno...

807
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,600
with time to spare.
- Agua!

808
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:51,900
Perhaps I'm beinga IittIeoptimistic.
HeIp! HeIp!

809
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:55,700
HeIp us!
- A rattIesnake! We're goingto die!

810
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,000
HeIp!
- I don't want to...

811
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,100
Good morning.

812
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,100
Howdy.
- Hey, crazy EngIish ''cowboy wannabe'' man.

813
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:10,300
How's about goin'
and bein' crazy somepIace eIse?

814
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,300
You're bIockingthedamn path.
- WiIbur, it's him.

815
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,600
I'II bedamned.

816
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:22,600
Mr Fogg, my name is OrviIIe Wright.
This is my brother, WiIbur.

817
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,000
We're bigfans of yours.
- WeII, fan's a strongword.

818
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,600
We got a Iot of money ridingon you
to win your bet. You gonna win it?

819
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:34,600
We'II useour winnings to buiId this.
- OrviIIe, maybe now's not the time.

820
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,600
Let me expIain it to Mr Fogg.
Onesecond. You gotta forgive my brother.

821
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:42,600
He's got his head up in thecIouds.
He's oneof thesesad IittIedreamers.

822
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,000
Thinks oneday man's gonna go
swooshingaround the pIanet...

823
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,100
Iikea hummingbird fIyingthrough theair.
We'reaII gonna fIy, Orv!

824
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:55,100
He thinks so, too. It's reaIIy sad.
I'm sorry. He's kind of a moron.

825
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:59,100
He's mastered thecabIesteeringsystem!
Thedragand Iift ratio!

826
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:02,300
This is briIIiant!
- That's what I've been saying,

827
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:07,100
but OrviIIedoesn't Iisten to me!
I'veaIways said that about mastering.

828
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:11,100
You gotta have faith in me, no matter
how crazy big brother's dreams sound.

829
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:14,500
But you toId me never to...
- I said you've gotta speak up.

830
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:19,100
Excuse me, gentIemen. Have you come
across our friend on your way here?

831
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:23,100
Now, wait. Who're we Iookingfor?
I notice everything. - Passepartout.

832
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:27,100
You mean thecrazy haIf-naked Chinese guy
wesaw runningaround?

833
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:31,100
Singing ''Frere Jacques''?
- Yeah. He had a cow skuII on his head?

834
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:34,100
PossibIy.
- He's in the back of our wagon.

835
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:37,600
Passepartout! You'reaIive!
- Is that you, Grandma?

836
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,900
Goodbye!
- Go win the bet!

837
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:45,100
No pressure, but you've got to win it!

838
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:51,400
Now, you see, to get the reaI
cIassy dames, you gotta invent stuff.

839
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:54,600
I did.
- I did? What's with the ''I did''?

840
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,400
We're The Wright Brothers. Wedid. Go.

841
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,100
Fogg, never gonna make it,
never gonna make it!

842
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:29,500
New York! New York!
- So much to see, so IittIe time!

843
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,800
Our steamer for EngIand Ieaves
in ten minutes! - Go, go!

844
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,500
We're never goingto make it!
- PhiIeas Fogg?

845
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,600
WouId you autograph this for me, pIease?
It's for the wife. - CertainIy.

846
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,000
This business about me
robbingthe Bank of EngIand...

847
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,500
I'm from IreIand. Nice going.

848
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,800
The boat? AIright, comeon, foIIow me.
I know a shortcut.

849
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:09,400
Makea Iane!

850
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:23,100
Whereare we?

851
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:28,500
That's a big man!
- It is a Iady! A French Iady.

852
01:26:29,700 --> 01:26:32,800
She Iooks Iikean eviI
Chinese warIord to me.

853
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:46,000
Your journey has caused quitea stir.
But I'm afraid...

854
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,600
it ends here.
- Leave them aIone, Fang.

855
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,600
This has nothingto do with them.
- On thecontrary, Lau Xing.

856
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,600
Lord KeIvin and I have made
new arrangements to conquer Lanzhou.

857
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:01,700
UnfortunateIy for Mr Fogg,
they entaiI...

858
01:27:02,600 --> 01:27:06,000
his permanent detour.
- I knew KeIvin was dupIicitous,

859
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:10,000
but to aIign himseIf
with such a IittIescoundreI...

860
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,000
AIright, you're not a scoundreI!
But you arequitesmaII!

861
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,700
As in petite.
But most definiteIy IethaI...

862
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:21,400
and generaIIy very scary.

863
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:23,200
1, 2...

864
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,200
Go!
- 3!

865
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,700
Go up there!
- Stop them!

866
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,500
Passepartout! My cane!

867
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,800
There.

868
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,800
Passepartout! HeIp! Weare trapped!

869
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,800
Ouch.

870
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,100
HeIp!

871
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,200
Passepartout!

872
01:28:53,700 --> 01:28:56,300
There you are!

873
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,600
There's a knife in your right buttock!

874
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:29,600
It's the eviI Chinese warIord!

875
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:32,900
She is coming!

876
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:36,900
The boat!

877
01:29:37,200 --> 01:29:39,800
Up there! Hurry! Go!

878
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,600
Go, Mr Fogg! There's not much time!

879
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,000
Wait! What am I thinking?
Passepartout can't defeat them...

880
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:07,600
aII by himseIf. He's nine Tigers short.

881
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,000
PhiIeas, I do beIieve
you are becomingthe man of my dreams.

882
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,600
When this is over, Iet's hope thearms
and Iegs of the man of your dreams...

883
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:21,700
arestiII attached to the torso...
of the man of your dreams.

884
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,000
You have faiIed to stop him.
- Then your death wiII have to suffice.

885
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:13,700
Let go of me!
- The book! It's goingto faII!

886
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,700
How can wesave... PhiIeas?
- I wiII save him!

887
01:31:27,700 --> 01:31:30,300
Get her! Mr Fogg!

888
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,200
Passepartout.

889
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,200
Passepartout! You'reaIive!
Are you injured?

890
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
RuIes are made to be broken.

891
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,900
Or stabbed by a spiky shoe.

892
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,000
Mr Fogg, you missed theship.
You wiII Iose your bet.

893
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,800
WeII, at Ieast I didn't Iosea friend.

894
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,600
You must be the eIeventh Tiger.

895
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,800
Meow.

896
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,600
Let's go.
We must catch the next ship.

897
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:56,600
It wouId never reach London in time.

898
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,900
No, no!
Weare not giving up!

899
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:06,000
I aImost died! You aImost died!
We take next ship...

900
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,200
and win that bet!

901
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,700
Very weII. Let's go.

902
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,200
Yes.
- Yes.

903
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:18,000
Thank you.

904
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:54,400
Yes! Yes! Yes!

905
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:59,400
It's no use. By thosecaIcuIations,
I'm stiII behind by...

906
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:03,100
oneday.
- There must besome way!

907
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:06,700
PhiIeas Foggon my boat?
What an honor, sir!

908
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:11,600
I havequitea penny wagered on you.
The wife's not too happy about it.

909
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,000
Then again, she hasn't cracked a smiIe
since theday...

910
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:19,100
that shark aImost devoured me.
Got 'em both in one bite.

911
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:38,500
It's Inspector Fix! My goodness!

912
01:34:39,100 --> 01:34:42,400
He made it around the worId before Fogg!

913
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:45,700
I came back from India theshort way,
you ninny!

914
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:50,500
I take it you don't have PhiIeas Fogg
in that vaIise.

915
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,300
A IittIe Jade Buddha, perhaps?

916
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,400
Mr Fogg? I'm sorry to say
we've burnt the Iast of thecoaI.

917
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,600
But I've had a word with thecrew...

918
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,900
and aII of them haveagreed
to burn their shoes.

919
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,700
I appreciate that,
but we're not even cIose.

920
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,000
We've gained a meresix hours.
Even shoes cannot heIp us now.

921
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:47,300
There must besomethingwecan do.

922
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:57,700
That's it. I've got it.

923
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:02,100
Birds!
- ExceIIent idea! We'II burn birds!

924
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:06,100
No. We'II fIy to London!
We'II simpIy foIIow the Iaws of physics,

925
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:09,500
mastered by the birds miIIennia ago,
and combine it...

926
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,600
with the Wright Brothers'
ingenious cabIesteeringsystem.

927
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,700
Most peopIe wouId Iaugh at you.
But not us.

928
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,200
Wecareabout you.

929
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,600
Captain, I'm afraid I have
to ask permission to dismantIe your ship

930
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,900
to buiId this fIying machine.
- DismantIe Carmen?

931
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,600
But she's my IiveIihood,
my most IoyaI companion! Never, never!

932
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,100
What if I couId direct you to an
impeccabIe physician who couId repIace...

933
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:46,100
both your nippIes at my expense?
And I wiII give you enough money...

934
01:36:46,100 --> 01:36:48,900
to buy a brand new ship.

935
01:36:49,300 --> 01:36:52,700
You had meat the nippIes.
CorneIius, fetch my tooI kit now!

936
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:39,600
I'II go sharpen the propeIIer.

937
01:37:48,700 --> 01:37:51,600
Wrongway. Not Iooking.

938
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,500
The Greenwich Time Zone.
The Iast time I shaII set my watch ahead.

939
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:39,600
ShaII we fIy?
- Let's.

940
01:38:40,100 --> 01:38:41,900
Mr Fogg...

941
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:50,400
Inspiringwords. Very weII.

942
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:54,800
Prepare for take-off.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:10,100
Mr Fogg, are you sure?
- No!

944
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:23,300
How the heII are we getting back?

945
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:30,100
Now!

946
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:40,400
You did it, PhiIeas!
Weare fIying!

947
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,700
My God, it's...

948
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,800
It's magicaI!
- Better than your dreams?

949
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:51,200
Better than my dreams.
- Hey! Don't forget to steer!

950
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:13,000
It's...

951
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:16,800
a teIegram from GeneraI Fang, sir.

952
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,100
We're goingto make it!

953
01:40:31,700 --> 01:40:35,100
Is this aIright?
- It's exactIy Iikea dream I had.

954
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,600
You dreamed of winningthe race?
- No, of crashingto my death.

955
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:42,500
Don't worry. I'm gonna get it.

956
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:47,400
Look up there!
It's a fIying machine!

957
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:51,900
Don't stepon the wing!

958
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,800
Sir, rumor has it that a fIying machine
is headingfor the RoyaI Academy,

959
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,800
our bike thief at the pedaIs.
- Some peopIe wiII beIieveanything.

960
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:04,200
A fIying machine
is headingtowards the RoyaI Academy!

961
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:08,800
The bike thief is pedaIing!
- See what I mean?

962
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:13,300
WeII done, Passepartout!

963
01:41:13,300 --> 01:41:15,900
The wing ropes!

964
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,400
Just a minor setback!
Another minor setback!

965
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:24,000
AIright, this is a major setback.

966
01:41:24,900 --> 01:41:28,300
A fIying machine is heading
for the RoyaI Academy of Science,

967
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:32,300
and witnesses swear
that it's Foggat thecontroIs...

968
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:35,700
Go faster, Passepartout!
- We're IosingaItitude!

969
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:40,700
Landing gear?
- That wouId have been an exceIIent idea!

970
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:45,000
The birdmen arecoming!

971
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,600
I wiII not Iose this wager!

972
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,000
He's not to reach the topstep!
Get the poIice! Here!

973
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:59,600
I want PhiIeas Foggarrested
the moment his feet touch British soiI!

974
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,600
Stupid! You're hurting my ear!

975
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:07,400
Passepartout, get back in your seat!
We're goingto return to the ground.

976
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:15,600
Stop, Kitchner! HoId your ground!

977
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:19,300
Why are they aII fIeeing?

978
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:21,300
Coward!

979
01:42:56,100 --> 01:43:00,100
You have to make it to the topstep!
- Ah, New ZeaIand. Wedidn't go there.

980
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:03,100
Topstep!
- Arrest them!

981
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:06,100
They robbed the Bank of EngIand!
- Nonsense!

982
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:10,500
Where is your proof?
- This is the RoyaI Academy of Science!

983
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:14,100
Wedon't need to proveanything!
Besides,

984
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:18,500
by the time you get out of jaiI,
you'II have Iost the wager.

985
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,900
Noon.
- Wedid our best.

986
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,800
Get out of my way!
I used to besomebody important!

987
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:35,900
I shouId have thrown him
through a higher window.

988
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,100
Get rid of this buffoon!
- Buffoon? This is the thanks...

989
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:44,100
I get for goin' haIfway 'round the worId
to stop Foggfor you?

990
01:43:44,100 --> 01:43:47,500
HeaIso sent a Chinese warIord
to kiII PhiIeas Fogg!

991
01:43:48,100 --> 01:43:50,900
That's true! Hedid!
- Lies!

992
01:43:51,900 --> 01:43:53,700
AII of it!

993
01:43:56,100 --> 01:43:58,100
Kitchener!
- Yes?

994
01:43:58,100 --> 01:44:01,300
TeII them!
- Uh, weII... um, the thingof it is...

995
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,900
MumbIing moron.
SaIisbury, transIate Kitchner's...

996
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:09,600
incoherent bIather.
- I... he, I... Yes!

997
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:12,900
Rhodes!
- Uh, the thingof it is...

998
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:16,300
I don't want to makea fuss about...
- You spineIess cretins!

999
01:44:18,600 --> 01:44:21,600
That man stuck me with quiIIs!
- What?

1000
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:25,700
Bunches of them.
- Yes! Lord KeIvin's a buIIy!

1001
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:30,000
It is true! I hate to admit it,
but I'm a battered Lord!

1002
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:34,900
Boo hoo!

1003
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:38,700
So what if I did try to kiII PhiIeas Fogg?

1004
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,200
What are you gutIess peons goingto do
about it! I hoId aII the power!

1005
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:48,100
I run everything! So which of you haIfwits
is goingto stop me?

1006
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,300
You? You? You?

1007
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:54,200
The Queen!
- The Queen?

1008
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,100
Oh, the Queen!

1009
01:44:57,100 --> 01:45:00,100
That inbred antiquated oId cow.

1010
01:45:01,100 --> 01:45:04,500
TheonIy way shecouId stop me
is if shesat on me...

1011
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:08,100
with her big, fat RoyaI bottom!

1012
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:16,800
She's behind me, isn't she?

1013
01:45:17,200 --> 01:45:20,600
Your Majesty,
I have just apprehended thecuIprits...

1014
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,600
who robbed the Bank of EngIand.
- No, Majesty! It's not true!

1015
01:45:27,400 --> 01:45:29,200
Quiet!

1016
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:33,600
I Iove beingabIe to do that.

1017
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,700
So, Lord KeIvin,
unsportsmanIikeconduct...

1018
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,000
attempted murder,
trading my arsenaI for Buddhas...

1019
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,700
How did you know about that?
I never said...

1020
01:45:45,100 --> 01:45:48,400
Admit it!
You've been a naughty boy, haven't you?

1021
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:50,700
Yes!

1022
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:54,500
Your Majesty,
there is an expIanation for aII of this.

1023
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,300
What it was... I was...

1024
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,800
I was simpIy...

1025
01:46:04,200 --> 01:46:08,200
Why do they aIways run?
Arrest him!

1026
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,600
Unhand me! Don't you know who I am?

1027
01:46:14,700 --> 01:46:17,500
I am no PhiIeas Fogg!

1028
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:21,300
So is this PhiIeas Fogg's
miracuIous fIying invention?

1029
01:46:22,100 --> 01:46:25,100
Your Majesty, weaII invented it.

1030
01:46:25,600 --> 01:46:28,900
I'm very impressed.
And that doesn't happen often.

1031
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,600
Thank you.
- But stiII we faiIed...

1032
01:46:33,100 --> 01:46:36,300
to heIp PhiIeas win his bet.
I'm sorry, PhiIeas.

1033
01:46:37,100 --> 01:46:40,100
Don't be, ma chérie. I saw the worId.

1034
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,900
I Iearned of new cuItures,
I fIew across an ocean.

1035
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,500
I wore women's cIothing,

1036
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:53,800
madea friend,

1037
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:58,200
feII in Iove.
Who cares if I Iost a wager?

1038
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:02,800
I do!
I've got twenty quid ridingon you.

1039
01:47:03,600 --> 01:47:07,000
But Your Majesty, it is past tweIve noon.

1040
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:11,600

No.

1042
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,700
as we passed each time zone.

We've won! Thank God!

1048

Your Majesty, I apoIogize.
Do forgive me. I quite forgot myseIf.
