1
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,622
-Honey, I'm home.
- Roger that.

2
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,210
Copy at the boathouse.
Right on time.

3
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,373
Faisil, getyour butt in here.
Harry's inside.

4
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:07,592
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

5
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:13,094
- Hey, wereyou born in a barn?
- Whorehouse.

6
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:21,646
All right. You got
your fur-coated razor blade there...

7
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:24,141
and a bunch of guys with guns.

8
00:03:27,696 --> 00:03:29,321
I'm switching to sub-vocal now.

9
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,944
Check, check.

10
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:33,861
- Check,, check,.
- It's talk radio.

11
00:03:33,952 --> 00:03:35,150
- You're on the air.
- Check.

12
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:54,294
That guard nearest to you
is moving away.

13
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:05,520
He's at the service door.
He's inside.

14
00:04:47,605 --> 00:04:49,063
Have you seen Khaled yet?

15
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,351
Yep, there he is.

16
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,650
How come billionaires
are always short?

17
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,492
Excuse me.

18
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,320
Thankyou.

19
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,079
Colonel! How areyou?

20
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:13,203
- It's so good to seeyou again.
- Yes, it's been a long time.

21
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,371
- Terrific.
- Who was that guy?

22
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:20,124
Could you hold this
for a second? Thanks.

23
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:25,305
You should be crossing the main foyer,
heading forthe stairs.

24
00:05:30,894 --> 00:05:33,219
Keep moving. Keep moving.

25
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,189
I'm in the library, heading out
to the second-floor balcony.

26
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,797
Modem in place.
Transmitting now.

27
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,210
Affirmatory.

28
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:50,050
It's a good hook-up.

29
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:54,085
These are encrypted files.
It's going to take me a few minutes.

30
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:58,054
I got your password.

31
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:41,676
- Magnificent, isn't it?
- Yes, quite.

32
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:45,431
I thought I knew Khaled's friends,
but I don't believe I've metyou before.

33
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,307
We haven't met,
because I certainly would remember.

34
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:50,722
Renquist, Harry Renquist.

35
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:54,609
- Juno Skinner.
- Juno Skinner.

36
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,316
Come on!

37
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,859
"Juno Skinner,
arts and antiquities dealer...

38
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:03,359
specializing in ancient Persia."

39
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:06,204
This is Persian,
if I'm not mistaken.

40
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,417
Very good.
Sixth century BC, to be exact.

41
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:14,084
- Doyou like the period?
- I adore it.

42
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:26,630
We got a problem.
Guards are going apeshit down there.

43
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,677
Acquired most ofthese pieces
forJamal.

44
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,761
Doyou tango?

45
00:08:33,356 --> 00:08:34,601
Tango?

46
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:38,474
Harry,you do not have time
to tango, buddy.

47
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:40,645
You copy?

48
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:31,317
Don't be stopping to smell
the roses now. You hear me?

49
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:34,614
- You gotta get out of there.
- Yes! Files are unlocked!

50
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:37,327
Fast Faisil strikes again.
I'm in. I'm down, baby.

51
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:39,988
I got my hand up her dress,
and I am going for the gold--

52
00:09:40,085 --> 00:09:41,912
Just copy the goddam files, okay?

53
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:14,609
Wow. And I thought
this was just gonna be...

54
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,785
another bunch ofboring bankers
and oil billionaires.

55
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:20,705
Seconds count.
Ditch the bitch.

56
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,240
Unfortunately, I have to leave.

57
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:26,409
I have a plane to catch.

58
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,793
Well, call me sometime.

59
00:10:32,885 --> 00:10:35,091
My offices are in Rome.

60
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,218
I would like that.

61
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,855
Son of a bitch is with her two minutes,
and she's ready to bear his children.

62
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,306
Twinkletoes,
what'syour exit strategy?

63
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,773
I'm going to walk
right out ofthe front gate.

64
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,398
Ballsy. Stupid, but ballsy.

65
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,320
Sir, may I see
your invitation, please?

66
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,200
Sure. Here is my invitation.

67
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,751
Shit. Here we go.

68
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,420
Slight change in plans.

69
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:38,943
Stay!

70
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,289
We're en route to
the lower rendezvous point.

71
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:03,008
Repeat, back-up rendezvous point!

72
00:12:04,594 --> 00:12:08,461
- Watch it!
- It's called ice, and it's slick.

73
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,824
- Harry, doyou copy? Whoa!
- I got it.

74
00:12:30,535 --> 00:12:31,316
Shit!

75
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,735
Whoops!

76
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh, my God!

77
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:22,913
Whoa! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

78
00:13:25,461 --> 00:13:26,659
- There he is!
- Shit!

79
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:29,831
Hi, guys.

80
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,754
That worked good.
Right out the old front gate.

81
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:36,838
Can you lean back a second?

82
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,017
Let's go.
We can still make our flight.

83
00:13:53,821 --> 00:13:58,364
All right, that's it
for Mr Renquist. Okay, go.

84
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:04,073
We got Harry Tasker billfold,
Harry Tasker passport, ticket stub.

85
00:14:04,164 --> 00:14:07,449
Hotel bill, Tasker.
I got two postcards here from Geneva.

86
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,326
Got some house keys right there...

87
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:14,872
and I've got a souvenir
Swiss snowing village.

88
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:17,255
- What's that for?
- It's for Dana, stupe.

89
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,715
Bring your kid home a gift,
the dad thing.

90
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:20,967
Nice touch.

91
00:14:21,055 --> 00:14:24,720
- Pick me up tomorrow at 8:00.
- Will do.

92
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:29,717
The debriefing is at 1 000.

93
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,891
- Seeyou at 8:00. Bye.
- Hey, Harry.

94
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:35,354
Did you forget something?

95
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:39,192
What a team.

96
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,569
Sleep fast, buddy.

97
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:23,685
Hi, honey. How wasyour flight?

98
00:15:25,155 --> 00:15:27,481
- It was fine.
- Good.

99
00:15:42,006 --> 00:15:46,002
Broughtyou a little gift
from Switzerland. Snowy village.

100
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:48,927
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

101
00:15:49,012 --> 00:15:51,503
- I've never had one ofthese.
- You're welcome.

102
00:15:51,597 --> 00:15:53,637
You're late for school.
You better get going.

103
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,809
- Don't forget to feed Gizmo.
- Okay.

104
00:15:56,894 --> 00:15:59,467
It's pretty lame.

105
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:07,942
- I'm late.
- Yeah, me too.

106
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:11,480
How'd it go at the convention?
Make all the other salesmen jealous?

107
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:14,361
It was fantastic.
You wouldn't believe it.

108
00:16:14,453 --> 00:16:17,073
You should have been there.
We were the big hit ofthe show.

109
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:20,662
With that new model ordering system,
the 680 I told you about...

110
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,038
I can write up an order
and immediately...

111
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:26,875
as soon as the customer's name comes up,
you see what his credit line is...

112
00:16:26,964 --> 00:16:30,378
what he has ordered in the past,
what discount he has gotten.

113
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,172
- Every little detail.
- Sounds great.

114
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:36,048
It's fantastic. That's why
I love the computer business.

115
00:16:36,138 --> 00:16:38,131
Listen, the plumber called.

116
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:42,720
He says he has to dig under the slab
or something that's gonna cost $600.

117
00:16:42,811 --> 00:16:46,228
- That's okay.
- It's not okay. It's extortion.

118
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,308
What did you tell him?

119
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,815
I slept with him and
he said he'd knock off $1 00.

120
00:16:51,903 --> 00:16:54,358
That's good thinking.
Bye, honey.

121
00:16:58,075 --> 00:16:59,867
Hello!

122
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Boy, I remember the first time
I got shot out of a cannon.

123
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:37,062
- Good morning. Go to school.
- Yeah, I am.

124
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,908
Thanks, dear.

125
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,902
Check these out.

126
00:17:44,994 --> 00:17:46,369
Check them out.

127
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,779
Where's the image coming from?

128
00:17:48,873 --> 00:17:52,573
Got a CCD camera and a transmitter
in a pack of smokes out there.

129
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:54,660
It's pretty cool, huh?

130
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,380
What the hell?

131
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:07,880
Bye, Dad!

132
00:18:08,975 --> 00:18:12,011
- She's rippingyou off.
- I knew it.

133
00:18:16,732 --> 00:18:18,771
Let's go!

134
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,017
Can't stop! I'm late! Bye, Dad!

135
00:18:21,738 --> 00:18:23,729
God. Shit.

136
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:29,034
Kids. Ten seconds ofjoy,
30years ofmisery.

137
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,905
I got married three times, but at least
I was never dumb enough to have any.

138
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:35,447
She shouldn't be stealing.
I taught her better than that.

139
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,534
You're not her parents any more,
you and Helen.

140
00:18:37,626 --> 00:18:39,868
Her parents are
Axl Rose and Madonna.

141
00:18:39,962 --> 00:18:43,663
Five minutes a dayyou spend with her
can't compete with that bombardment.

142
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,334
You're outgunned, Daddy-o.

143
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:48,592
It's not just
becauseyou're a bad parent.

144
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,216
Kids today are ten years ahead
ofwhere we were at the same age.

145
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,298
- Morning.
- Morning, MrTasker.

146
00:18:53,392 --> 00:18:55,598
- I betyou think she's still a virgin.
- Don't be ridiculous.

147
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:57,725
- She's only-- What is she now?
- She's 1 4.

148
00:18:57,813 --> 00:19:01,098
- She's only 1 4.
- Her hormones are going like an alarm.

149
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:03,349
It's even money she lets that physicist
on the bike boink her.

150
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:05,269
- Not Dana.
- "Not Dana."

151
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,112
Denial. It's not just a river
in Egypt no more, is it?

152
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,818
She's probably stealing the money
to pay for an abortion.

153
00:19:10,908 --> 00:19:13,399
Why don'tyou open the door?

154
00:19:13,493 --> 00:19:15,402
Or drugs.

155
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,409
Twenty here, 50 there. I figured
my wife's boyfriend was taking it.

156
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,621
He takes everything else. There's
never a beer in the goddam fridge.

157
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:27,084
- Thoughtyou moved out.
- I had to move back, in.

158
00:19:27,173 --> 00:19:30,044
My lawyersaid it'd give me
a bettershot at getting the house...

159
00:19:30,134 --> 00:19:32,839
during the property settlement,
but don't change the subject.

160
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:35,799
- You still owe me 200 buck,s.
- Good morning,Janice.

161
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,814
- Good morning.
- Identify yourselves to the scanner.

162
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,897
- Harry Tasker, 1 0024.
- Albert Gibson, 34991.

163
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:08,458
All right, Frances. I don't believe
we need you any longer now. Thankyou.

164
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:22,639
Sweet Jesus. You sure screwed
the pooch last night, didn'tyou?

165
00:20:22,725 --> 00:20:27,885
Would you please tell me how I can see
this as anything but a total disaster?

166
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:30,186
"Total" is a strong word.

167
00:20:30,274 --> 00:20:32,349
There are different
degrees oftotality.

168
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:35,775
It's a scale, really, with
a perfect mission on one end...

169
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:39,111
and then a total pooch screw
on the other, and we're more on this--

170
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:42,484
Faisil, you're new on Harry's team,
aren'tyou?

171
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:44,994
Yes.

172
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:50,453
So what makesyou think the slack
I cut him in any way translates toyou?

173
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,748
Let me showyou what we got.

174
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:00,378
Jamal Khaled. We think he's dirty,
so we raid his private financial files.

175
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,388
One hundred million in wire transfers
from the Commerce Bank International.

176
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,390
Which is a front for certain countries
to finance terrorist activities.

177
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:11,227
That's why we think
something really big is going down.

178
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,434
We know that a week ago
four MIRV warheads were smuggled...

179
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:15,645
out ofthe former
Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan.

180
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,811
We think Khaled's group bought the nukes
and is trying to bring them to US soil.

181
00:21:19,902 --> 00:21:23,236
So far this is not
blowing my skirt up, gentlemen.

182
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:26,988
Don'tyou have anything
remotely substantial?

183
00:21:27,076 --> 00:21:30,112
Harry, doyou have any hard data?

184
00:21:30,204 --> 00:21:33,904
- Nothingyou would call rock-hard.
- Actually it's pretty limp, sir.

185
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,375
Then perhapsyou better get some...

186
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,163
before somebody parks an automobile
in front ofthe White House...

187
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:41,170
with a nuclearweapon in the trunk.

188
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:43,829
It's not like
he's saving the world or anything.

189
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:46,416
He's a sales rep, for Christ's sake.

190
00:21:46,511 --> 00:21:49,713
Whenever I can't sleep,
I ask him to tell me about his day.

191
00:21:49,805 --> 00:21:52,047
Six seconds and I'm out.

192
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:55,178
He acts like he's curing cancer
or something.

193
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,558
I guess this meansyou didn't
get away for the weekend after all.

194
00:21:57,646 --> 00:22:00,102
- Harry had to go out oftown.
- I'm shocked.

195
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,266
Yeah, well, you know Harry.

196
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:08,278
- What's up?
- Check this out.

197
00:22:08,364 --> 00:22:12,409
There's a $2 million disbursement
from Khaled to Juno Skinner.

198
00:22:12,494 --> 00:22:14,486
That's right.
The babe at the party.

199
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:20,497
That doesn't mean anything.
She buys antiquities for Khaled.

200
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:23,704
He keeps his antique buys
on a completely separate ledger.

201
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:26,416
This is a little above market rate
for the horizontal bop...

202
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,748
even for a total biscuit
like her.

203
00:22:28,842 --> 00:22:31,167
I want a complete workup on her.

204
00:22:31,261 --> 00:22:34,132
- Do we know where she is?
- Right here in River City.

205
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:37,092
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff
for the Smithsonian.

206
00:22:37,183 --> 00:22:40,183
She has a lot of diplomatic connections,
so she has offices here.

207
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:42,760
I guess it's time
to send in a specialist.

208
00:22:44,439 --> 00:22:47,394
- Care to tango?
- Yes, I would.

209
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:53,570
Assholes.

210
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:02,079
It's all set up. You got a fax machine,
ghost phones, all the usual stuff.

211
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:05,996
You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel
under the name of Renquist.

212
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:08,207
Reality check. Let's go.

213
00:23:08,295 --> 00:23:12,791
My name is Harry Renquist. I own
an art consulting firm in San Francisco.

214
00:23:12,883 --> 00:23:14,959
I have an appointment
with Miss Skinner.

215
00:23:15,052 --> 00:23:17,258
- Harry!
- Hello.

216
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:18,804
Hello.

217
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:22,009
I thought I'd seeyou again.
I just didn't know itwould be so soon.

218
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,136
- What's the point ofwaiting?
- I agree.

219
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:31,940
Your clients are looking for something
forthe lobby oftheir new headquarters?

220
00:23:32,027 --> 00:23:34,148
They would like to see something
very dramatic.

221
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:36,276
That's a nice piece.

222
00:23:36,363 --> 00:23:40,277
I talked to a number of people,
and they all said you're the one to see.

223
00:23:40,367 --> 00:23:43,320
Really? Checking on me.

224
00:23:43,411 --> 00:23:47,492
So what did these people
say about me exactly?

225
00:23:47,582 --> 00:23:51,994
That you can read ancient Sanskrit
without having to sound out the words...

226
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:56,415
and other art dealers and archaeologists
don't like you very much.

227
00:23:57,424 --> 00:23:59,132
Those wimps.

228
00:23:59,218 --> 00:24:03,512
It's because I use my diplomatic
contacts to export cultural treasures...

229
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:06,716
from countries which tell them
to take a hike.

230
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,807
Most of our pieces
come from ancient Persia.

231
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,893
Unfortunately, ancient Persia is 20 feet
under the sand of Iran, Iraq and Syria.

232
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,692
Not the most popular places
lately.

233
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:27,738
So I've had to become an expert
in international diplomacy.

234
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,576
Well, Mr Renquist?

235
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,912
Doyou see anythingyou like?

236
00:24:37,003 --> 00:24:39,245
Maybe.

237
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:43,253
Give me a break. I don't think
they bugged my tuna sandwich.

238
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:45,465
She's importing stuff
from all over the Mideast.

239
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,461
She could be moving
money, guns, anything.

240
00:24:47,555 --> 00:24:49,761
The second you left, we started
getting calls to the ghost numbers.

241
00:24:49,848 --> 00:24:51,840
They were checking out
the Renquist front.

242
00:24:51,933 --> 00:24:54,685
Let's step up the surveillance
and put on two more guys.

243
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,813
Maurizio, I said Saturday,
not Tuesday. Saturday.

244
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,229
Miss Skinner, may I have
a word with you, please?

245
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:19,996
Stupid, undisciplined bitch.

246
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:23,169
It's a good thing
you're paying me a lot of money.

247
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:28,424
Doyou realize there are surveillance
teams watching this place right now?

248
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:30,797
Yourtelephones are
almost certainly tapped.

249
00:25:30,886 --> 00:25:35,346
And you were busy laughing and flirting
like a whorewith this Renquist--

250
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:37,674
He checked out okay--

251
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:41,098
We do not tolerate mistakes.

252
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,726
What would you like me to do?

253
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,144
Find out where this Renquist is.

254
00:25:51,155 --> 00:25:53,230
Hello, Tektel Systems.
MrTasker's office.

255
00:25:53,323 --> 00:25:55,993
Hi, Charlene? Hi, it's Helen.
Is he in?

256
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:59,695
Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs Tasker.
Let me try him in there. Hold, please.

257
00:26:00,831 --> 00:26:02,954
Relay, 1 0024.

258
00:26:04,542 --> 00:26:07,080
It's a patch from Tektel.

259
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:09,914
It's Helen.

260
00:26:10,006 --> 00:26:12,675
Hello, honey. How areyou?
What's going on?

261
00:26:12,758 --> 00:26:15,428
Hi. I'm sorry to botheryou
in the middle ofa meeting.

262
00:26:15,512 --> 00:26:18,346
It's just that Dana and I want to make
sureyou were gonna be home by 8:00.

263
00:26:18,431 --> 00:26:20,719
We're going to a lot oftrouble
foryour big birthday.

264
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:24,508
We justwanted to make sure
thatyou were gonna be home.

265
00:26:24,603 --> 00:26:26,761
Absolutely.
This timeyou can count on me.

266
00:26:26,854 --> 00:26:28,230
- Promise?
- Trust me.

267
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:30,105
- Great.
- Got to go. Bye.

268
00:26:30,191 --> 00:26:31,141
Bye.

269
00:26:31,234 --> 00:26:34,401
- That's disgusting, Dana.
- Calm down.

270
00:26:36,864 --> 00:26:40,863
We got a friend.
Three cars back on the inside lane.

271
00:26:40,952 --> 00:26:44,201
They've been on us
since we left the hotel.

272
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:46,281
- You mean the station wagon?
- Yes.

273
00:26:46,373 --> 00:26:50,453
- You want me to lose them?
- No. We need this lead.

274
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:51,575
Unit Seven?

275
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,410
Seven here.

276
00:26:54,505 --> 00:26:56,996
We needyou at the Georgetown Mall
in three minutes.

277
00:26:57,092 --> 00:27:00,626
- Copy. We're rolling.
- Helen's gonna be pissed.

278
00:27:01,304 --> 00:27:03,711
This is the problem with terrorists.

279
00:27:03,806 --> 00:27:06,843
They're really inconsiderate
when it comes to people's schedules.

280
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,394
Pull over here. This is good.

281
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:27,194
- Okay, testing, one, two, three.
- I got you. I got you. I got you.

282
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:34,036
They're right with us.
I make three of them in the car.

283
00:27:45,678 --> 00:27:48,135
- Dickhead.
- Blow me.

284
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:07,027
I got a couple of them getting out
of the car and coming afteryou.

285
00:28:07,115 --> 00:28:08,907
Think I'm blind?

286
00:28:08,992 --> 00:28:12,989
You do look, lik,e Ray Charles.
So what's the plan?

287
00:28:13,078 --> 00:28:15,700
Just trying to get a closer look
at Beavis and Butt-head.

288
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:19,205
- There's a third one still in the car.
- Stay on him.

289
00:28:41,439 --> 00:28:44,854
Hi, Helen. Yeah, it's Gib.
Oh, not much.

290
00:28:44,942 --> 00:28:48,191
Listen, Harry forgot something
back at the office.

291
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:51,528
You know Harry.

292
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:55,030
Yeah, Gib, I know Harry. Bye.

293
00:28:55,118 --> 00:28:56,494
Bye. Seeyou soon.

294
00:28:57,621 --> 00:28:59,329
See?

295
00:29:41,995 --> 00:29:43,453
I lost the third guy.

296
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,272
Shit!

297
00:30:29,248 --> 00:30:33,327
Shit! Hold it! Shit!

298
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,086
Here. Cool off.

299
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:46,536
Sorry about this.

300
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:53,875
Look out! Get out ofthe way!

301
00:32:59,846 --> 00:33:01,838
Hey! Freeze!

302
00:33:10,731 --> 00:33:12,640
Oh, thank God.

303
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,081
Get in the car.

304
00:33:37,797 --> 00:33:39,257
Here we go.

305
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,359
Federal officer
in pursuit of suspect.

306
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:08,991
Sorry.

307
00:34:23,382 --> 00:34:26,965
- Harry, what's your 20?
- Westbound in the park.

308
00:34:27,052 --> 00:34:29,803
Suspect is on a motorcycle,
and he's coming out on Franklin.

309
00:34:29,888 --> 00:34:30,552
Copy!

310
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,556
I want you on 1 4th
in case he turns south.

311
00:34:33,642 --> 00:34:36,428
I want Seven on the north side
to box him in.

312
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:41,349
Make it quick, because
my horse is getting tired.

313
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:43,312
Your horse?

314
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:03,209
- There he is! That's him!
- Come on!

315
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,885
- Go around to the back.
- Copythat.

316
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,844
Out of my way!

317
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:37,320
Out of my way!

318
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,697
Sorry.

319
00:35:40,495 --> 00:35:41,954
Excuse me.

320
00:35:51,423 --> 00:35:53,331
-Jesus!
- Sorry.

321
00:35:54,634 --> 00:35:56,542
Open it!

322
00:35:59,012 --> 00:36:01,504
Excuse me. Excuse me.

323
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:15,231
Out of the way!

324
00:36:22,785 --> 00:36:24,444
Move! Move! Move!

325
00:36:27,998 --> 00:36:30,156
Federal officer! Get down! Now!
Get off or die!

326
00:36:31,918 --> 00:36:33,495
- Get down! Now!
- Move!

327
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:38,378
Turn around! Hold still!

328
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:40,339
Come on!

329
00:36:46,724 --> 00:36:48,052
Whoa!

330
00:36:53,606 --> 00:36:55,681
Hold still!

331
00:37:07,076 --> 00:37:09,116
Will you press the button
for the top floor, please?

332
00:37:10,788 --> 00:37:12,116
Thankyou.

333
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:18,493
Help!

334
00:37:18,587 --> 00:37:20,378
Shut up!

335
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:23,662
Whoa.

336
00:37:23,758 --> 00:37:26,593
Say something.

337
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,966
That's a fine animal.

338
00:37:47,613 --> 00:37:50,104
Stay against the glass!

339
00:37:51,242 --> 00:37:52,486
Come on.

340
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:54,285
So sorry.

341
00:37:57,831 --> 00:38:00,452
Stay there! Don't move!

342
00:38:23,522 --> 00:38:25,680
Come on, come on, come on!

343
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,442
Okay, back up.

344
00:39:20,533 --> 00:39:21,909
Back up.

345
00:39:25,372 --> 00:39:28,870
You can do it.
Come on.

346
00:39:28,959 --> 00:39:30,666
Good horse. Good.

347
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:33,242
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, go back now.

348
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,413
Come on.
Yeah, that's teamwork now.

349
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:37,711
Keep pulling. Come on.

350
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:41,846
A little bit more.

351
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:44,346
That a boy.

352
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,309
Okay.

353
00:40:00,987 --> 00:40:03,394
What the hell wereyou thinking?

354
00:40:04,283 --> 00:40:07,568
I had the guy,
and you let him get away.

355
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,705
Look at me when I talk toyou.
What kind of a cop areyou anyway?

356
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:33,850
Hi, honey.

357
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:41,017
I know you're upset.
I'm sorry.

358
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:44,856
I hurried home
as fast as I could.

359
00:40:48,157 --> 00:40:49,948
It's okay.

360
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:53,076
It's okay.

361
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:56,780
I'm sorry.

362
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:59,163
Thankyou for the party.

363
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,706
Yeah, it was great.

364
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,593
Hey.

365
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,308
That's him.

366
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:26,525
- Pause it right there.
- Salim Abu Aziz.

367
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:29,480
This guy is really hard-core.
Highly fanatical.

368
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:33,022
The man's a real psycho. He's been
linked to dozens of car bombings.

369
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,780
You know that cafe bomb
in Rome lastyear? That was his.

370
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,955
As well as a 727 out of Lisbon.
This guy's a major player.

371
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:44,490
Now he's formed his own splinter faction
called Crimson Jihad.

372
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,332
I guess he thought the other terrorists
were too warm and fuzzy for him.

373
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:51,125
- They call him the Sand Spider.
- Why?

374
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:53,456
Probably because it sounds scary.

375
00:41:53,551 --> 00:41:56,089
This is impressive, gentlemen.

376
00:41:56,178 --> 00:42:00,092
It would be even more impressive
ifyou actually knew where he was.

377
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:02,266
We'll get him.

378
00:42:02,851 --> 00:42:06,434
- Why don'tyou pull over here?
- What's up?

379
00:42:06,522 --> 00:42:09,605
I really screwed up
with Helen last night.

380
00:42:12,236 --> 00:42:17,145
I'm going to see if she's available
for lunch to smooth things over.

381
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,612
- You just want me to hang?
- Just hang.

382
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,242
I'll just be hanging.

383
00:42:27,332 --> 00:42:28,826
Hold, please.

384
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:33,753
- It'syour mystery man on two.
- Simon?

385
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,120
Oh, my God.

386
00:42:41,638 --> 00:42:43,095
Hello? Simon?

387
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,007
Simon?

388
00:42:45,849 --> 00:42:47,722
Yes, I can talk.

389
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:53,225
You mean right now?

390
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:55,438
Yes, I can meetyou.

391
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:58,903
Okay, I can't wait.

392
00:42:58,987 --> 00:43:00,066
Bye.

393
00:43:01,072 --> 00:43:03,064
Can you cover me for an hour?

394
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:05,779
Just an hour? You should tell
that stud to take more time.

395
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:09,735
Would you shut up?
I should have never told you about him.

396
00:43:12,666 --> 00:43:13,781
Have a good time.

397
00:43:15,251 --> 00:43:17,742
Get a little bit for me
whileyou're at it.

398
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:30,135
Hey! Hold it! Fucker!

399
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:32,264
What's going on? Sick?

400
00:43:32,351 --> 00:43:34,842
Looks likeyou got gut-kicked.

401
00:43:34,937 --> 00:43:39,349
It's Hel-- It's Helen--
It's Helen.

402
00:43:39,441 --> 00:43:41,813
It has something to do with Helen,
I'm guessing.

403
00:43:45,446 --> 00:43:47,320
Helen...

404
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:49,447
is having an affair.

405
00:43:53,787 --> 00:43:56,457
Welcome to the club, man.

406
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,200
It can't be. Not Helen.

407
00:43:58,292 --> 00:44:00,498
Nobody thinks it could happen to them
the first time.

408
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:03,456
Same thing happened to me
with wife number two, remember?

409
00:44:03,547 --> 00:44:07,046
I had no idea nothing was going on.
I come home, and the house is empty.

410
00:44:07,134 --> 00:44:10,632
She even took the ice cube trays
out ofthe freezer.

411
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,343
What kind of a sick bitch takes
the ice cube trays out ofthe freezer?

412
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:21,176
- It's not Helen.
- Helen still loves you.

413
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:25,139
She just wants to bang this guy
for a while. It's nothing serious.

414
00:44:25,233 --> 00:44:28,567
- You'll get used to it soon--
- Stop cheering me up!

415
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:33,566
What'd you expect?

416
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:35,983
Helen's a flesh-and-blood woman,
and you're never there.

417
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:39,111
It was just a matter oftime.

418
00:44:45,961 --> 00:44:48,583
I say we concentrate on work.

419
00:44:48,672 --> 00:44:51,079
That's what I do every time
my life turns to dog shit.

420
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:53,297
I concentrate on work,
and that gets me by.

421
00:44:53,385 --> 00:44:55,958
Right, buddy?
It's gonna be great.

422
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:58,509
We're gonna catch some terrorists.
We're gonna beat the crap out of them.

423
00:44:58,598 --> 00:45:00,756
You're going to feel a hell
of a lot better.

424
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,721
Watch your head.
Okay. All right.

425
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:14,441
Women. Can't live with 'em,
can't kill 'em.

426
00:45:31,921 --> 00:45:33,913
I came byyour office today.

427
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:38,050
I was in the area, and I thought
you might want to have lunch.

428
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:43,087
Really? Well,
you must have just missed me.

429
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:47,011
That's what they said. They said
you had to run out or something.

430
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,937
It was this rush job--

431
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:54,065
They needed these documents
down at the district courthouse.

432
00:45:54,149 --> 00:45:57,483
So, of course, the big problem--
our printer shut down.

433
00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:01,698
So I went to the third floor
to use theirs, but they have the 1 720.

434
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:05,316
Of course, the disk
isn't formatted for the 1 720.

435
00:46:05,411 --> 00:46:08,244
So I had to go back upstairs
and reformat...

436
00:46:08,329 --> 00:46:10,737
go back downstairs
and use their printer.

437
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:13,501
By the time I got there,
I couldn't get my car to start.

438
00:46:13,585 --> 00:46:16,704
Then traffic--
I barely got there.

439
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:24,634
So a little excitement
in an otherwise dull day.

440
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,344
Did it work out okay?

441
00:46:28,182 --> 00:46:30,221
Yeah. Great.

442
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,178
I'll check on dessert.

443
00:46:34,271 --> 00:46:36,263
I'm done.

444
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:45,104
The great thing is that he's practically
given us a blank cheque on wiretaps.

445
00:46:45,197 --> 00:46:48,151
I set them up on all ofJuno's
shipping agents and her clients.

446
00:46:48,242 --> 00:46:50,318
Faisil's made a list
ofall the possible contacts...

447
00:46:50,411 --> 00:46:52,402
the Crimson Jihad
may have in this country.

448
00:46:52,496 --> 00:46:54,737
Now all we have
to do is sit around--

449
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:01,869
Hey. This national security stuff
boringyou?

450
00:47:01,964 --> 00:47:05,414
- Put a tap on her phone.
- What? I already did that.

451
00:47:05,508 --> 00:47:09,718
I'm talking about Helen's. Put a tap
on her office line and the house. Now.

452
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:12,674
Come over here for a second.
That sounds great.

453
00:47:12,764 --> 00:47:15,682
I want to askyou about something.
I got two words to describe that idea--

454
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:18,886
In-sane. An unauthorized wiretap's
a felony. You know that.

455
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:23,059
And you're doing it 20 times a day,
so don't give me that crap.

456
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:24,608
Do it.

457
00:47:36,953 --> 00:47:40,322
- Hello?
- Helen, it's Simon. Is it safe to talk,?

458
00:47:40,416 --> 00:47:42,906
Yes, go ahead.

459
00:47:43,001 --> 00:47:45,753
I can't talk long. Can you meet me
for lunch tomorrow? I must see you.

460
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:49,085
I suppose so. Where?

461
00:47:49,173 --> 00:47:54,084
Same place, 1 :00.
I have to go now. See you tomorrow.

462
00:47:54,178 --> 00:47:56,503
Remember, I needyou.

463
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:18,694
I thought that we might
have lunch together tomorrow.

464
00:48:20,243 --> 00:48:23,245
You know-- darn it--

465
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,374
I'm going to meet Allison.
We're going to go shopping. Sorry.

466
00:48:28,418 --> 00:48:30,210
No problem.

467
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:08,903
I thinkyou're going about
this whole thing all wrong.

468
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:11,121
Women-- they likeyou
to talk to them.

469
00:49:11,208 --> 00:49:13,830
Maybe it's just thatyou're not
in touch with yourfeminine side.

470
00:49:13,919 --> 00:49:17,620
I waswatching SallyJessyRaphael--
All right.

471
00:49:17,714 --> 00:49:20,584
I got all the usual stuffhere--
a telemetry burst transmitter.

472
00:49:20,675 --> 00:49:23,712
I got a GPS tracker, an audio
transmitter and a power supply.

473
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:27,967
I've got it sewn into the lining here--
Hey, Harry?

474
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:31,011
Ifyou need to talk,
speak into the purse.

475
00:49:35,689 --> 00:49:38,773
Here she comes. She's gonna pop out
right in front of us. Watch this.

476
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:40,650
Bingo.

477
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:47,064
Looks like she's going
into Chinatown.

478
00:49:50,995 --> 00:49:52,276
She's parking.

479
00:50:00,629 --> 00:50:03,464
Okay, give me audio.

480
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:13,297
You sureyou weren't followed?

481
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:19,094
No. I kept looking behind me like
you taught me, but I didn't see anyone.

482
00:50:19,188 --> 00:50:21,477
Okay, it's just that things
are a bit hot right now.

483
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:25,942
If I get a signal,
I may have to leave suddenly.

484
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:27,521
I understand.

485
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,283
Look, it's my job to take risks,
but not yours.

486
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:39,866
I feel bad about bringingyou into this,
butyou're the only one I can trust.

487
00:50:41,709 --> 00:50:43,333
Were you out on a mission?

488
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:50,835
We say "op," covert operation.
And this one, well, got a little rough.

489
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:53,333
- Worse than Cairo?
- Cairo.

490
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:57,847
Cairo was a day at the beach
next to this.

491
00:50:57,932 --> 00:51:01,051
- The guy's a spook.
- But forwhom?

492
00:51:01,143 --> 00:51:03,219
He could be working her
to get toyou.

493
00:51:03,938 --> 00:51:07,390
- Did you read the papersyesterday?
- Yes.

494
00:51:12,113 --> 00:51:15,529
Sometimes a story is a mask
for a covert operation.

495
00:51:15,616 --> 00:51:18,188
You see two men killed in a restroom
and two unidentified men...

496
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:20,989
in a running shootout,
ending at the Marriott?

497
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,657
That was you?

498
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,206
- Me.
- You're very good.

499
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:25,571
You recognized my style.

500
00:51:25,666 --> 00:51:28,288
You're a natural at this.

501
00:51:28,377 --> 00:51:30,703
The guy's a fake.
He's taking credit for our moves.

502
00:51:30,797 --> 00:51:33,334
- What happened?
- Hardly worth talking about.

503
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,166
Two ofthem
won't bother me again.

504
00:51:36,261 --> 00:51:39,711
- Unbelievable.
- You chased one?

505
00:51:39,806 --> 00:51:43,754
Something came over me. I had to nail
this guy no matterwhat the risk.

506
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,602
Pretty hairy. I thought
he had me a couple oftimes, but I--

507
00:51:46,687 --> 00:51:50,269
- I really can't take credit.
- Why not?

508
00:51:51,106 --> 00:51:53,858
It's the training. It shapesyou
into a lethal instrument.

509
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:55,935
You react in a microsecond
without thinking.

510
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:59,147
I'm starting to like this guy.

511
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:02,690
We still gotta kill him.
That's a given, you know.

512
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,098
The guy is a goddamned
used car salesman.

513
00:52:31,186 --> 00:52:33,937
This keeps getting better and better!

514
00:52:35,356 --> 00:52:37,847
I'm sorry.
I know this has gotta be painful.

515
00:52:37,943 --> 00:52:40,729
But you gotta admit it's funny.
If it was just some idiot, not you...

516
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:43,144
you'd be laughingyour ass off.

517
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:46,274
One born every minute.

518
00:52:47,368 --> 00:52:51,151
It wantsyou too.
Feel it vibrate?

519
00:52:51,246 --> 00:52:53,916
- Say, how about a little spin?
- Sure.

520
00:52:56,376 --> 00:52:59,377
See, it's not just a car.
It's a total image. An identity.

521
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:02,297
You have to go for it.
This isn't some high-tech sports car.

522
00:53:02,381 --> 00:53:05,216
To tell you the truth,
it doesn't even handle that great.

523
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:07,377
But that's not the idea, is it?

524
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:10,388
What are we talking about here?
Pussy, right?

525
00:53:12,182 --> 00:53:14,258
Absolutely.

526
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:20,598
Let's face it.
The 'Vette gets 'em wet.

527
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,932
But it's not enough.

528
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:27,444
Ifyou really want to close escrow,
you gotta have an angle.

529
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:30,447
I suppose you have an angle.

530
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:32,360
It's killer.

531
00:53:32,451 --> 00:53:35,487
I mean, look at me.
I'm not that much to look at.

532
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,701
No, no, no.
I can be honest.

533
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:41,373
But I got 'em lining up,
and not just the skanks either.

534
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:43,535
- Well, some are.
- What'syour angle?

535
00:53:45,338 --> 00:53:48,125
No, sorry. Trade secret.

536
00:53:48,215 --> 00:53:51,170
Okay,just askyourself:

537
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,253
What do women really want?

538
00:53:53,345 --> 00:53:56,263
You take these bored housewives
married to the same guy foryears.

539
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:58,424
They're stuck in a rut.
They need some release.

540
00:53:58,517 --> 00:54:01,056
The promise of adventure,
a hint of danger.

541
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:04,262
I create that for them.

542
00:54:04,355 --> 00:54:06,762
So basically you're lying
your ass offthe whole time.

543
00:54:06,859 --> 00:54:09,942
- I couldn't do that.
- What areyou, a Boy Scout?

544
00:54:10,028 --> 00:54:12,020
Think ofit as playing a role.
It's fantasy.

545
00:54:12,113 --> 00:54:14,070
You gotta work on their dreams...

546
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:17,857
get them out oftheir daily
suburban grind for a few hours.

547
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:20,027
- What about their husbands?
- Dickless!

548
00:54:20,121 --> 00:54:23,406
I mean, let's face it.
Ifthey took care ofbusiness...

549
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:26,037
I'd be out ofbusiness,
you know what I mean?

550
00:54:26,126 --> 00:54:28,083
Those idiots.

551
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:32,540
You mind keeping it under 90?

552
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:35,123
I'm still trying
to pay for this dental work.

553
00:54:35,218 --> 00:54:37,542
So, who areyou
working on right now?

554
00:54:37,637 --> 00:54:39,795
I always got a couple on the hook.

555
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:43,340
There's this one right now,
I got her panting like a dog.

556
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:45,675
- It's great.
- What does she do?

557
00:54:45,769 --> 00:54:48,557
Some sort oflegal secretary
or something.

558
00:54:48,648 --> 00:54:51,221
You know,
uptight and conservative.

559
00:54:51,316 --> 00:54:53,605
But she could be so hot
if she wanted to be.

560
00:54:53,693 --> 00:54:56,018
And with you,
she gets to be real hot.

561
00:54:56,113 --> 00:54:58,520
Red hot!
Her thighs steam.

562
00:54:58,614 --> 00:55:01,319
It's like a dying plant.
Just needs a little water.

563
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:04,160
- Married to some boring jerk.
- Some boring jerk?

564
00:55:04,245 --> 00:55:07,779
He doesn't appreciate her.
She's like all these babes.

565
00:55:07,873 --> 00:55:11,158
You get their pilot lit,
they can suck-start a leaf-blower.

566
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:15,835
She's got the most incredible body,
and a pair oftitties...

567
00:55:15,922 --> 00:55:18,495
makeyou want to stand up
and beg for buttermilk.

568
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:20,667
Ass like a ten-year-old boy.

569
00:55:27,893 --> 00:55:31,142
So, then she must be
really good in bed then, huh?

570
00:55:31,228 --> 00:55:33,221
Slow down.
You'll miss the turn.

571
00:55:46,367 --> 00:55:47,826
See?

572
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,362
You and this carwere made
for each other. Why fight it?

573
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:54,871
Sure, I got a couple other buyers
on the line, but I likeyour style.

574
00:55:54,959 --> 00:55:57,082
So, what doyou say?

575
00:55:57,169 --> 00:55:59,541
Should we start up
the paperwork?

576
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:01,540
Let me think about it.

577
00:56:01,632 --> 00:56:03,624
Hold it for me for a day, okay?

578
00:56:05,552 --> 00:56:08,007
Hey, because it'syou.

579
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,212
I got today's transcripts.

580
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:13,300
Not much going on.

581
00:56:15,019 --> 00:56:17,308
- Nothing from Simon?
- No.

582
00:56:29,658 --> 00:56:31,651
- My turn to drive?
- Give me the page.

583
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,735
- What?
- This jumped from page 9 to 1 1.

584
00:56:33,828 --> 00:56:35,820
- Where's page 1 0?
- It's gotta be a typo.

585
00:56:35,913 --> 00:56:37,906
Give me the goddam page!

586
00:56:47,549 --> 00:56:50,420
- Seek help, Harry.
- Hello?

587
00:56:50,511 --> 00:56:54,342
Helen, I need your help.
Can you meet me tonight?

588
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,388
- What's happened?
- It's serious.

589
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,633
Meet me on K Street...

590
00:56:58,726 --> 00:57:01,098
under the Key Bridge,
8:00 sharp.

591
00:57:03,814 --> 00:57:05,012
Gotcha.

592
00:57:05,983 --> 00:57:09,268
Shit. It's almost 8:00.

593
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:17,657
She's still at the house.

594
00:57:17,744 --> 00:57:19,783
Thepurse is still at the house.

595
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,414
Shit.

596
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,710
Unit Two, Unit Seven,
immediate roll.

597
00:57:25,793 --> 00:57:28,463
Acquire subject
at K Street and Key Bridge.

598
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:32,129
Vehicle is red and white convertible.
You got exactly six minutes.

599
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:34,920
Wait a minute.
Areyou out ofyour mind?

600
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,509
You can't pull agents off a priority
surveillance to followyourwife.

601
00:57:38,597 --> 00:57:42,890
That's a misappropriation ofresources
and a breach ofnational security.

602
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:45,514
You copy?
You're losing it big-time, man.

603
00:57:45,603 --> 00:57:48,439
- I have to stop you.
- What areyou gonna do, tell?

604
00:57:48,523 --> 00:57:51,274
Look, goddam it.
Both of our butts are on the line.

605
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:54,809
Soyour life's in the crapper.
Yourwife's banging a used car salesman.

606
00:57:54,903 --> 00:57:58,070
It's humiliating, I know,
but take it like a man!

607
00:57:58,157 --> 00:58:00,827
-You tell on me, I tell on you.
- What areyou talking about?

608
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:03,863
I'm as clean as a preacher's sheets.
I'm as clean as--

609
00:58:03,953 --> 00:58:05,947
What about when you blew
a six-week operation...

610
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:09,040
becauseyou were busy
getting a blow-job?

611
00:58:09,126 --> 00:58:11,332
You knew about that?

612
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:15,122
Let's take Franklin.
It's quicker.

613
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,778
Quick, get in.
Hurry up. Let's go.

614
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:56,456
Two here.
Suspect vehicle in sight.

615
00:58:56,545 --> 00:58:58,536
One male, one female.

616
00:58:58,629 --> 00:59:01,335
Now, don't be alarmed.

617
00:59:01,424 --> 00:59:04,093
If I'm spotted, it'd be best
ifthey didn't seeyou.

618
00:59:04,176 --> 00:59:06,465
You should keep your head down
till we're out ofthe city.

619
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,678
Here, let me help you.

620
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:14,177
That's better.

621
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,063
Nowthe woman has herhead
in the guy's lap.

622
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:24,187
Southbound on the Key Bridge.
Two in pursuit.

623
00:59:24,279 --> 00:59:27,611
Roger, Two.
One to Condor, you got a visual?

624
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:32,191
Roger, One. This is Condor.
Subject is in sight.

625
00:59:32,287 --> 00:59:34,408
Repeat: We have the ball.

626
00:59:34,496 --> 00:59:37,533
We got a pretty good lock,up
on infrared.

627
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:40,661
She's got her head
in the guy's lap, all right.

628
00:59:41,921 --> 00:59:44,458
Maybe she's sleepy.

629
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,293
This is a safe house.

630
00:59:50,386 --> 00:59:53,139
My place in the city
is a little too hot right now.

631
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,261
So is the penthouse in New York.

632
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:10,896
What is it exactly
you need me to do?

633
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,322
I want you to be my wife.

634
01:00:15,410 --> 01:00:17,401
But I'm married!

635
01:00:17,495 --> 01:00:21,907
It's just for the operation in Paris.
I need to be married.

636
01:00:21,998 --> 01:00:23,991
They'll be looking for a man
travelling alone.

637
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:27,085
You want me to go to Paris?

638
01:00:27,171 --> 01:00:29,708
Paris, with a quick stopover
in London.

639
01:00:34,261 --> 01:00:36,929
There's a double agent in my outfit.
I don't know who.

640
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:41,547
There's no one I can trust,
except you.

641
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:43,635
Can you get away,
just for a couple of days?

642
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,720
I just don't know.

643
01:00:45,813 --> 01:00:48,185
Of course. I'm rushing you.
Forgive me.

644
01:00:48,273 --> 01:00:50,645
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

645
01:00:52,569 --> 01:00:55,273
Let me pouryou some more wine.

646
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:14,536
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

647
01:01:15,632 --> 01:01:19,132
You just saved my life.

648
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:22,089
You are incredibly brave.

649
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,012
I have to remind myself
ofthe fearyou must be feeling.

650
01:01:26,101 --> 01:01:28,674
You see, for me
fear is not an option.

651
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:32,767
Now, in order to pull
this cover story off...

652
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:36,142
we have to look like two people who are
completely intimate with each other.

653
01:01:36,235 --> 01:01:38,227
The enemy can spot a fake easily.

654
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,608
- You see what I mean?
- Sorry.

655
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,694
That reaction could
get us both killed.

656
01:01:47,786 --> 01:01:51,287
- I'm sorry.
- We can't afford that.

657
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,033
Try to relax.

658
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:55,165
It's just been a long time...

659
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:57,624
since anybody but Harry's
touched me like that.

660
01:01:57,713 --> 01:02:00,251
- It's a little difficult.
- I know.

661
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:03,128
- It's awkward for me too.
- I'm sorry.

662
01:02:03,218 --> 01:02:06,503
- That's all right.Just sit back.
- I'm okay.

663
01:02:07,222 --> 01:02:09,214
There. That's better.

664
01:02:10,516 --> 01:02:14,182
Just let yourself
slip into the role.

665
01:02:22,737 --> 01:02:25,488
That's it.

666
01:02:25,573 --> 01:02:27,565
There you go.

667
01:02:29,075 --> 01:02:31,827
Just let yourself go.

668
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:33,322
That's good.

669
01:02:33,413 --> 01:02:35,203
That's great.

670
01:02:36,373 --> 01:02:37,833
That's it.

671
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:40,455
No, I can't do this.
I can't do this.

672
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:43,331
- What's wrong? It's okay.
- I cannot do this.

673
01:02:43,423 --> 01:02:44,881
I cannot do this!

674
01:02:49,052 --> 01:02:51,626
If not for me...

675
01:02:51,722 --> 01:02:53,713
do it foryour country?

676
01:03:23,626 --> 01:03:25,998
Oh, God!
Don't hurt me!

677
01:03:26,087 --> 01:03:28,044
I'll do whateveryou want!

678
01:03:29,465 --> 01:03:31,374
Please!
I didn't do anything!

679
01:03:40,434 --> 01:03:41,975
Damn it!

680
01:04:03,204 --> 01:04:06,787
Take her! Take her!
Oh, God, don't hurt me!

681
01:04:11,296 --> 01:04:14,001
Son ofa bitch!

682
01:05:04,846 --> 01:05:06,921
Sit down.

683
01:05:09,475 --> 01:05:11,966
Isaidsit down.

684
01:05:16,272 --> 01:05:18,764
Who doyou work, for?

685
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:25,152
Stern, Kessler,
Goldstein & Krumpnick.

686
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:28,608
- I'm just a legal secretary.
- Sure, Mrs Tasker.

687
01:05:28,701 --> 01:05:31,322
What wereyou doing
with the international terrorist...

688
01:05:31,412 --> 01:05:33,570
Carlos theJack,al,
tak,ing dictation?

689
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,451
How long have you been
a member of his faction?

690
01:05:36,541 --> 01:05:38,534
I don't know anything
about a faction.

691
01:05:40,796 --> 01:05:43,583
I just met Simon...

692
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,461
or whoeveryou say he is...

693
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,543
just a couple weeks ago.

694
01:05:48,636 --> 01:05:50,214
I barely know him.

695
01:05:50,304 --> 01:05:52,297
That's not what it looked like
when we found you.

696
01:05:54,016 --> 01:05:56,637
How did you meet him?

697
01:05:58,604 --> 01:06:00,145
Well--

698
01:06:11,491 --> 01:06:14,195
Keep this for me.
I can't afford to be taken with it.

699
01:06:14,286 --> 01:06:16,989
- What?
- It's a matter of national security.

700
01:06:17,079 --> 01:06:21,373
Please, it's important.
I'll contact you.

701
01:06:21,459 --> 01:06:23,450
Oh, shit.

702
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,986
Why didyou continue
to see him?

703
01:06:58,075 --> 01:07:00,151
He said he needed my help.

704
01:07:00,244 --> 01:07:02,735
Not becauseyou were
attracted to him?

705
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:07,118
You were not attracted
to him at all?

706
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:16,753
Well, maybe just a little.

707
01:07:16,844 --> 01:07:20,260
-So, is cheating a common thing foryou?
-Never.

708
01:07:20,347 --> 01:07:23,466
So you're telling me
this wasyour first time?

709
01:07:23,557 --> 01:07:26,180
I wasn't cheating!

710
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:28,558
Tell me aboutyour husband,
MrsTasker.

711
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:39,108
What can I say about Harry?

712
01:07:39,197 --> 01:07:41,404
He's a sales rep
for a computer company.

713
01:07:41,492 --> 01:07:45,488
So sex with him isn't exactly
wavingyour flag any more?

714
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:49,243
That is none ofyour goddam business!
What kind of questions are these?

715
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:52,083
You're in a lot oftrouble,
so I suggestyou cooperate.

716
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,658
Ifwe want to know the most
intimate details about your life...

717
01:07:54,754 --> 01:07:57,078
you'd better tell us.

718
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,833
My husband is a good man.

719
01:08:01,927 --> 01:08:04,963
But he's not exactly ringing
your bell these days, is he?

720
01:08:05,054 --> 01:08:09,183
Let me handle this part.
Doyou mind?

721
01:08:09,267 --> 01:08:12,303
Why didyou go
to Carlos'hideout?

722
01:08:12,396 --> 01:08:15,313
He wanted me to go to Paris with him
on a mission...

723
01:08:15,397 --> 01:08:19,063
to pose as his wife.

724
01:08:19,151 --> 01:08:21,144
And you agreed?

725
01:08:23,405 --> 01:08:25,232
Why?

726
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:29,320
I don't know.

727
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:31,818
I guess I neededsomething.

728
01:08:32,705 --> 01:08:34,365
What did you need?

729
01:08:40,546 --> 01:08:43,297
I needed to feel alive.

730
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:49,212
I just wanted to do
something outrageous.

731
01:08:53,058 --> 01:08:56,509
And it felt really good...

732
01:08:56,603 --> 01:08:58,594
to be needed.

733
01:09:02,692 --> 01:09:04,684
And to be trusted.

734
01:09:08,031 --> 01:09:10,983
And to be special.

735
01:09:11,075 --> 01:09:13,068
It's just that there's...

736
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,283
so much I wanted to do
with this life...

737
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:17,861
and it's like
I haven't done any of it.

738
01:09:17,956 --> 01:09:20,791
And the sand's running out
ofthe hourglass...

739
01:09:20,876 --> 01:09:23,662
and I wanted to be able
to look back and say...

740
01:09:23,752 --> 01:09:26,326
"See? I did that!

741
01:09:26,422 --> 01:09:30,336
I was reckless and I was wild
and I fucking did it!"

742
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:38,507
Quite frank,ly,
I don't give a shit...

743
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,807
whetheryou understand that ornot.

744
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:44,896
This Simon...

745
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:50,268
did you sleep with him?

746
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,480
- No.
- She's lying.

747
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,490
You did not have
sexual relations with him?

748
01:10:01,038 --> 01:10:04,157
Listen, ifyou're gonna ask me
every question twice...

749
01:10:04,249 --> 01:10:08,116
this is gonna take a really long time,
and I have to get back to my family.

750
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,619
You're not going anywhere, lady.

751
01:10:10,714 --> 01:10:13,667
Just let me out ofhere!

752
01:10:13,758 --> 01:10:15,584
Answerthe question.

753
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,595
- Answer the question!
- No!

754
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,766
I did not...

755
01:10:23,851 --> 01:10:26,721
sleep with him!

756
01:10:26,813 --> 01:10:28,471
Calm down, please.

757
01:10:28,563 --> 01:10:31,896
You hear me,
you chickenshit bastard?

758
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,985
- Calm down.
- She could be telling the truth.

759
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,228
Calm down, Mrs Tasker.

760
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:40,984
Calm down, please.

761
01:10:44,203 --> 01:10:48,071
I've only one more question,
Mrs Tasker.

762
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:49,410
What?

763
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:55,376
Do you still love your husband?

764
01:11:01,594 --> 01:11:04,843
Yes, I love him.

765
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:07,682
I've always loved him...

766
01:11:07,767 --> 01:11:10,055
and I will always love him.

767
01:11:15,565 --> 01:11:18,103
She lovesyou.
Now what?

768
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:25,316
There's only one solution
toyour problem, Mrs Tasker.

769
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,400
You must work, forus.

770
01:11:29,537 --> 01:11:31,493
What areyou doing?

771
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,071
- Just giving her a little assignment.
- You gotta be shitting me!

772
01:11:34,166 --> 01:11:37,617
She wants a little adventure,
so I'm gonna give her one.

773
01:11:37,712 --> 01:11:40,795
I'm offeringyou a choice.

774
01:11:40,881 --> 01:11:43,169
Ifyou work for us,
we will drop the charges...

775
01:11:43,258 --> 01:11:45,749
and you can go back
toyour normal life.

776
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:48,797
If not, you will go
to a federal prison...

777
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,430
andyourhusbandanddaughter
will be left humiliated and alone.

778
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:55,724
Yourlife will be destroyed.

779
01:11:59,523 --> 01:12:03,224
Gee. Let me think.

780
01:12:03,318 --> 01:12:05,726
Yes orno?

781
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,813
Of course yes.

782
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,899
What's involved?

783
01:12:09,992 --> 01:12:12,399
You will be contacted
with the assignment.

784
01:12:12,493 --> 01:12:15,613
The code name ofyour contact
will be Boris.

785
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:18,747
Your code name will be--

786
01:12:18,833 --> 01:12:20,990
- Natasha?
- No.

787
01:12:22,712 --> 01:12:23,910
Doris.

788
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:38,434
Pricks!

789
01:12:47,276 --> 01:12:50,230
You son of a bitch. Did you think
you could elude us forever, Carlos?

790
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,072
Wait! You got the wrong guy.
My name's Simon.

791
01:12:53,157 --> 01:12:56,526
Just let me go.
There's no need to kill me.

792
01:12:56,618 --> 01:12:59,074
I haven't seen your face--

793
01:12:59,162 --> 01:13:01,155
Don't! I didn't see it!
I didn't see it!

794
01:13:05,793 --> 01:13:07,287
It'syou!

795
01:13:07,377 --> 01:13:09,833
Hey, you still interested
in that 'Vette at all?

796
01:13:09,921 --> 01:13:11,998
Hey, Carlos.
The game's over.

797
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,296
Your career as an international
terrorist is well documented.

798
01:13:14,384 --> 01:13:15,842
- No!
- Oh, yeah!

799
01:13:15,928 --> 01:13:18,466
I sell cars.
That's all!

800
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:21,342
Come on.
I'm not a terrorist.

801
01:13:21,432 --> 01:13:25,762
I'm actually a complete coward.
If I ever saw a gun I'd-- Oh, God!

802
01:13:25,853 --> 01:13:28,771
Oh, please, don't!
Don't kill me!

803
01:13:31,192 --> 01:13:33,896
I'm not a spy.

804
01:13:33,986 --> 01:13:37,769
I'm nothing!
I'm navel lint!

805
01:13:37,865 --> 01:13:42,942
I have to lie to women to get laid.
And I don't score much.

806
01:13:43,912 --> 01:13:47,246
I got a little dick.
It's pathetic.

807
01:13:48,917 --> 01:13:50,292
Oh, God.

808
01:13:51,669 --> 01:13:55,453
Would a spy pee himself?
Huh?

809
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,624
Please, I'm not worth a bullet.

810
01:13:59,717 --> 01:14:03,419
- Have mercy, sir.
- Get the fuck out ofhere.

811
01:14:03,514 --> 01:14:05,257
Just beat it.
Go on.

812
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,509
As soon as I turn,
you're gonna shoot me!

813
01:14:09,603 --> 01:14:11,393
You're gonna shoot me!

814
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,729
Please! You can have
the car for free.

815
01:14:14,815 --> 01:14:16,808
What do you say, huh?

816
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:19,938
Get lost, dipshit.

817
01:14:40,006 --> 01:14:42,960
So last night must've been
pretty exciting foryou.

818
01:14:47,054 --> 01:14:48,881
My flat tyre?

819
01:14:48,972 --> 01:14:50,965
Actually, it was a little scary...

820
01:14:51,058 --> 01:14:54,093
because the tow truck driver
took such a long time.

821
01:15:01,443 --> 01:15:03,020
I'll get it.

822
01:15:05,071 --> 01:15:06,481
Hello?

823
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:08,149
Doris?

824
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:14,451
Yes?

825
01:15:16,374 --> 01:15:17,784
Listen carefully.

826
01:15:17,874 --> 01:15:20,910
In exactly one hour,
go to the Hotel Marquis.

827
01:15:21,919 --> 01:15:24,837
Pick, up an envelope mark,ed "Doris"
at the front desk,...

828
01:15:24,923 --> 01:15:27,081
- and dress sexy.
- What?

829
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:34,011
No, no.
Turn around.

830
01:15:34,098 --> 01:15:37,182
Do it doucement.

831
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:39,224
Do it very slowly.

832
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:41,516
You've reached a new
all-time low.

833
01:15:41,604 --> 01:15:43,763
I can't believe you're crazy enough
to use the suite at the Marquis.

834
01:15:43,856 --> 01:15:47,356
Doyou think I can afford
a suite like this on my salary?

835
01:15:47,443 --> 01:15:49,436
- IsJean-Claude doneyet?
- Hang on.

836
01:15:49,529 --> 01:15:51,521
Who wrote this shit? Harry?

837
01:15:54,701 --> 01:15:56,277
It's going great.

838
01:16:09,714 --> 01:16:12,122
Doyou have an envelope for Doris?

839
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:30,981
This is Doris.

840
01:16:31,067 --> 01:16:34,934
Listen, you are
a prostitute named Michelle.

841
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,947
Go to the room.
There will be a man there.

842
01:16:38,032 --> 01:16:40,701
He is a suspectedarms dealer.

843
01:16:40,784 --> 01:16:42,492
Now, wait a minute.

844
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:46,575
You don't expect me to, uh,
you know.

845
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:49,749
No. He has particular tastes.

846
01:16:49,835 --> 01:16:52,919
He lik,es to watch.

847
01:16:53,004 --> 01:16:57,630
Tell him that his regular girl,
Carla, is sick.

848
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:00,208
Ifhe lik,esyou,
he will tellyou what to do.

849
01:17:00,303 --> 01:17:02,461
You must plant the bug...

850
01:17:02,554 --> 01:17:06,006
nearthe telephone bythe bed
beforeyou leave.

851
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:08,851
Ifyou do not
complete your mission...

852
01:17:08,936 --> 01:17:10,928
the deal is off.

853
01:17:12,564 --> 01:17:14,688
I'm gonna go to hell.

854
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:33,353
Have some champagne.

855
01:19:47,875 --> 01:19:49,618
Come in here.

856
01:20:08,895 --> 01:20:11,897
My name is Michelle.

857
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:14,105
Carla thought you'd like me.

858
01:20:14,192 --> 01:20:16,267
Let me do the talk,ing.

859
01:20:16,361 --> 01:20:18,982
You may start by
unzippingyour dress.

860
01:20:22,366 --> 01:20:25,984
No, no. Turn around.

861
01:20:26,078 --> 01:20:30,122
Do it doucement.
Do it very slowly.

862
01:20:36,713 --> 01:20:38,421
Good.

863
01:20:39,591 --> 01:20:42,425
Now slip the dress down slowly.

864
01:20:54,353 --> 01:20:55,682
Good.

865
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:04,608
Now slide your nylons off
one by one.

866
01:21:07,408 --> 01:21:08,986
I'm not wearing any.

867
01:21:09,076 --> 01:21:10,950
That's good.

868
01:21:13,037 --> 01:21:15,447
Now, dance for me.

869
01:21:22,338 --> 01:21:24,081
Dance sexy.

870
01:21:24,174 --> 01:21:28,919
Let your hands be your lover's hands
on your own sk,in asyou move.

871
01:23:36,046 --> 01:23:38,963
Now lie on the bed
and closeyour eyes.

872
01:23:45,514 --> 01:23:47,671
I thought you only
liked to watch.

873
01:23:52,895 --> 01:23:56,264
Now lie on the bed
and closeyour eyes.

874
01:25:21,144 --> 01:25:22,804
You pig!

875
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:25,439
Bastard!

876
01:25:36,992 --> 01:25:38,949
Wait, wait, wait.

877
01:25:44,625 --> 01:25:48,668
Yes, it's Harry. I know it looks bad,
but I can explain.

878
01:25:50,296 --> 01:25:52,704
Nobody move!

879
01:25:52,799 --> 01:25:55,503
Don't move!

880
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,002
Helen, just don't do anything.

881
01:25:59,096 --> 01:26:02,465
No, he has nothing to do with it!
I'm the oneyou want!

882
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:03,755
Shut up!

883
01:26:03,851 --> 01:26:06,176
Quiet, Helen.
Do what they say.

884
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:11,724
Come on, guys, let the hooker go.
She's not important.

885
01:26:11,816 --> 01:26:13,394
You don't need her.

886
01:26:13,484 --> 01:26:16,106
Harry, please,
just let me handle this.

887
01:26:16,195 --> 01:26:17,855
Shut up!

888
01:26:19,614 --> 01:26:21,904
What were you doing there?

889
01:26:21,992 --> 01:26:25,444
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
- Talk again and I'll kill you!

890
01:27:06,075 --> 01:27:09,029
I wish I could say
it's nice to seeyou again.

891
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,242
You know her?

892
01:27:12,665 --> 01:27:16,496
You know, this shade's
totallywrong foryou.

893
01:27:16,585 --> 01:27:18,873
Sowho'syour little friend?

894
01:27:18,962 --> 01:27:22,711
I'm Helen Tasker.
Harry is my husband. And you are?

895
01:27:22,799 --> 01:27:25,255
So now it's Tasker,
not Renquist.

896
01:27:26,761 --> 01:27:30,805
She's just some wacko hooker
I met down at the bar.

897
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:34,341
What is the matterwith you?
Just tell her the truth!

898
01:27:34,435 --> 01:27:37,103
We are married,
and we have a daughter.

899
01:27:37,187 --> 01:27:39,263
I don't know what
the crazy bitch is on.

900
01:27:39,356 --> 01:27:43,104
You should cut her loose
so we can get down to business.

901
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:45,232
Where did I get this then, huh?

902
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,313
Where did I get this?

903
01:27:54,662 --> 01:27:57,200
Something before takeoff?

904
01:27:57,289 --> 01:27:59,862
That hurt, you b--

905
01:28:04,588 --> 01:28:07,671
She was telling the truth,
wasn't she?

906
01:28:07,757 --> 01:28:09,750
She really doesn't know.

907
01:28:12,261 --> 01:28:13,969
How interesting.

908
01:29:03,142 --> 01:29:04,518
Bring them.

909
01:29:12,985 --> 01:29:14,977
Incredible, aren't they?

910
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:19,489
I call them the Four Horsemen.

911
01:29:19,573 --> 01:29:22,610
They're warrior figures...

912
01:29:22,702 --> 01:29:26,237
from the Persian Empire
of Darius I...

913
01:29:26,330 --> 01:29:28,323
around 500 BC.

914
01:29:30,792 --> 01:29:32,869
They're absolutely priceless.

915
01:29:35,048 --> 01:29:36,957
Pity.

916
01:29:59,028 --> 01:30:01,103
Wait, wait!

917
01:30:02,197 --> 01:30:03,656
Open it.

918
01:30:33,226 --> 01:30:35,302
Doyou know what this is?

919
01:30:37,397 --> 01:30:39,389
I know what this is.

920
01:30:42,610 --> 01:30:44,603
This is an espresso machine.

921
01:30:48,615 --> 01:30:51,190
It's a snow cone maker.
That's what it is.

922
01:30:55,579 --> 01:30:57,572
Is it a water heater?

923
01:31:01,294 --> 01:31:03,583
Doyou know why
you've been brought here?

924
01:31:03,671 --> 01:31:06,292
So that this man
can verify to the world...

925
01:31:06,382 --> 01:31:09,418
the Crimson Jihad
is now a nuclear power.

926
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:15,301
How can he do that?
He's just a salesman, for Christ's sake.

927
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,685
If I'm wrong about him,
the last thingyou'll see...

928
01:31:23,773 --> 01:31:26,477
will beyour blood
spraying across his face.

929
01:31:33,032 --> 01:31:37,445
It's a Soviet MIRV-6
from an SS-22 air launch vehicle.

930
01:31:37,536 --> 01:31:41,118
Thewarhead contains
1 4.5 kilograms of enriched uranium...

931
01:31:41,206 --> 01:31:43,033
and a plutonium trigger.

932
01:31:43,124 --> 01:31:45,117
The nominal yield is 30 kilotons.

933
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:03,265
What can I say?
I'm a spy.

934
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:14,986
You bastard!
You lying son ofa bitch!

935
01:32:15,071 --> 01:32:18,357
- Sorry, honey.
- Don'tyou call me honey!

936
01:32:18,449 --> 01:32:20,489
You don't ever get
to call me honey again!

937
01:32:20,577 --> 01:32:22,616
You understand me, you pig?

938
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:25,906
And I can verify that
they have the arming box...

939
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,785
and all the equipment necessary...

940
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:31,497
to detonate all fourwarheads.

941
01:32:40,386 --> 01:32:44,004
You have killed ourwomen
and our children...

942
01:32:44,098 --> 01:32:47,633
bombed our cities from afar
like cowards...

943
01:32:47,726 --> 01:32:51,890
and you dare
to call us terrorists?

944
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:54,767
Now the oppressed
have been given a mighty sword...

945
01:32:54,857 --> 01:32:58,690
with which to strike back
at their enemies.

946
01:32:58,778 --> 01:33:00,651
Unless you, America...

947
01:33:00,738 --> 01:33:03,443
pulls all military forces
out ofthe Persian Gulfarea...

948
01:33:03,532 --> 01:33:05,904
immediately and forever...

949
01:33:05,993 --> 01:33:08,910
the Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

950
01:33:08,997 --> 01:33:11,914
on one major U.S. city each week...

951
01:33:11,999 --> 01:33:14,406
until our demands are met.

952
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:18,878
First, we will detonate one weapon
on this uninhabited island...

953
01:33:18,963 --> 01:33:21,965
as a demonstration of our power...

954
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:26,296
and Crimson Jihad's willingness
to be humanitarian.

955
01:33:26,388 --> 01:33:29,803
However, ifthese demands
are not met...

956
01:33:29,891 --> 01:33:32,595
Crimson Jihad will rain fire...

957
01:33:32,685 --> 01:33:36,220
on one major American city
each week--

958
01:33:38,607 --> 01:33:40,315
Battery.

959
01:33:47,532 --> 01:33:49,857
Get another one, you moron.

960
01:33:49,951 --> 01:33:53,485
I think I have one in the truck.

961
01:33:55,539 --> 01:33:57,448
- What?
- Look at this.

962
01:33:59,251 --> 01:34:02,667
- That's not mine.
- Nice transmitter.

963
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:07,667
Miami Tower,
Jet Star 6479 Delta on final.

964
01:34:07,758 --> 01:34:09,882
- We'll be on the ground in 1 2 minutes.
- All right.

965
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:12,639
Tell those D.E.A. boys
to have the helos...

966
01:34:12,723 --> 01:34:14,714
hot and ready to fly
in 1 2 minutes.

967
01:34:14,807 --> 01:34:18,757
Signal's definitely stopped moving.
It's an island in the Keys.

968
01:34:23,690 --> 01:34:25,932
- We lost the signal.
- Shit!

969
01:34:45,002 --> 01:34:48,252
All right, everyone.
This is Samir.

970
01:34:49,381 --> 01:34:52,714
For 50 points,
see ifyou can guess his specialty.

971
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,674
Oral hygiene?

972
01:34:54,761 --> 01:34:59,174
- Not exactly.
- What's going on?

973
01:34:59,265 --> 01:35:01,887
Samir's just gonna ask Harry
a few questions.

974
01:35:01,976 --> 01:35:05,428
We're not even sure
which agency Harry works for.

975
01:35:05,521 --> 01:35:07,727
Now, Samir's absolutely first-class.

976
01:35:07,815 --> 01:35:11,598
On the other hand we have Harry,
who's managed to lie convincingly...

977
01:35:11,694 --> 01:35:14,481
to the woman he loves for 1 5 years.

978
01:35:14,572 --> 01:35:18,568
So it'll be interesting to see
how long he can resist.

979
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:20,650
This will help.

980
01:35:21,994 --> 01:35:24,782
You know, you should
swab that with alcohol.

981
01:35:24,873 --> 01:35:26,866
I might get an infection.

982
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,869
I'll return when
this has taken effect.

983
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,536
Because they're very well-funded
raving psychotics...

984
01:35:36,629 --> 01:35:39,167
and I'm getting a lot of money.

985
01:35:41,759 --> 01:35:44,131
What, you think I care
about their cause?

986
01:35:44,221 --> 01:35:47,922
Oryours?
Not at all.

987
01:35:49,225 --> 01:35:51,183
You're damaged goods, lady.

988
01:35:58,194 --> 01:36:00,401
Did you tell her about us?

989
01:36:00,489 --> 01:36:03,857
There is no "us,"
you psychopathic bitch.

990
01:36:03,950 --> 01:36:06,406
Oh, sure.

991
01:36:06,495 --> 01:36:08,535
You say that now.

992
01:36:13,378 --> 01:36:16,995
Thanks for everything.
It wasn't bad while it lasted.

993
01:36:17,089 --> 01:36:19,247
Let's go.

994
01:36:19,343 --> 01:36:21,299
You two stay here.

995
01:36:26,933 --> 01:36:28,926
There was nothing.

996
01:36:30,896 --> 01:36:32,272
I swear.

997
01:36:55,088 --> 01:36:58,339
What did they give you?

998
01:37:00,803 --> 01:37:03,923
Sodium Amytal,
or some other truth agent.

999
01:37:05,392 --> 01:37:07,384
It makes you tell the truth?

1000
01:37:11,398 --> 01:37:13,889
Is it working?

1001
01:37:13,983 --> 01:37:16,901
Ask me a question
that I normally would lie to.

1002
01:37:19,114 --> 01:37:22,032
- Are we gonna die?
- Yep.

1003
01:37:22,118 --> 01:37:24,443
I'd say it's working.

1004
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:28,202
They're gonna shoot us in the head,
or they're gonna torture us to death...

1005
01:37:28,290 --> 01:37:30,497
or they're gonna leave us here
and let the bomb--

1006
01:37:36,925 --> 01:37:39,962
How long have you been a spy?

1007
01:37:44,183 --> 01:37:46,223
Seventeen years.

1008
01:37:57,864 --> 01:38:00,153
Have you ever killed anyone?

1009
01:38:02,953 --> 01:38:05,278
Yeah, but they were all bad.

1010
01:38:35,237 --> 01:38:40,613
Is there anything you want to tell me
before we start?

1011
01:38:40,702 --> 01:38:42,160
Yeah.

1012
01:38:42,244 --> 01:38:44,654
I'm going to kill you pretty soon.

1013
01:38:44,748 --> 01:38:46,824
I see.

1014
01:38:47,918 --> 01:38:50,705
How, exactly?

1015
01:38:50,796 --> 01:38:55,125
First, I'm going to use you
as a human shield.

1016
01:38:55,217 --> 01:38:57,923
Then I'm going to kill
this guard over there...

1017
01:38:58,012 --> 01:39:00,504
with the Patterson trocar
on the table.

1018
01:39:01,558 --> 01:39:03,883
And then I was thinking
about breakingyour neck.

1019
01:39:06,187 --> 01:39:09,687
And what makesyou think
you can do all that?

1020
01:39:09,774 --> 01:39:12,230
You know my handcuffs?

1021
01:39:12,318 --> 01:39:14,110
I picked them.

1022
01:39:37,179 --> 01:39:39,171
Let's get out ofhere.

1023
01:40:29,318 --> 01:40:31,192
Come on!

1024
01:41:13,199 --> 01:41:15,108
Drop the gun!

1025
01:41:22,083 --> 01:41:24,870
Honey, next time, duck.

1026
01:41:30,217 --> 01:41:33,420
- Let's go.
- I married Rambo.

1027
01:41:59,665 --> 01:42:01,658
What are they doing?

1028
01:42:24,357 --> 01:42:26,268
It is done.

1029
01:42:29,488 --> 01:42:33,238
In 90 minutes,
a pillar ofholy fire...

1030
01:42:33,326 --> 01:42:35,485
will light up the skies...

1031
01:42:38,874 --> 01:42:41,116
to show to the world...

1032
01:42:41,209 --> 01:42:43,784
that we speak the truth.

1033
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,772
We are set on our course.

1034
01:43:01,857 --> 01:43:04,145
No force can stop us now.

1035
01:43:04,234 --> 01:43:07,105
We're cool, we're bad-asses,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1036
01:43:07,195 --> 01:43:09,948
Ifwe're on an island,
why are they using trucks?

1037
01:43:10,032 --> 01:43:13,068
We must be in the Florida Keys.

1038
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:15,782
The overseas highway connects
the islands to the mainland.

1039
01:43:15,871 --> 01:43:18,873
There's no borders, no customs.

1040
01:43:18,959 --> 01:43:22,328
They can go anywhere in the U.S.
There's nothing to stop them.

1041
01:43:23,380 --> 01:43:24,838
Just us.

1042
01:43:26,716 --> 01:43:29,966
- Here, take this.
- Oh, shit.

1043
01:44:56,063 --> 01:44:57,307
Shoot!

1044
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:14,951
Shit!

1045
01:48:14,316 --> 01:48:16,024
Let's go.

1046
01:48:23,284 --> 01:48:26,653
My condolences to the widow.

1047
01:48:42,513 --> 01:48:45,005
We may need the hostage.

1048
01:48:47,311 --> 01:48:49,719
Okay, let's go, Suzy Homemaker.

1049
01:48:56,236 --> 01:48:58,029
Hurry up!

1050
01:48:58,113 --> 01:49:00,106
Just get her in the car.
Let's get going.

1051
01:50:11,276 --> 01:50:15,523
- I thought this looked like yourwork.
- Let's go. I'll briefyou in the air.

1052
01:50:15,613 --> 01:50:19,279
You're welcome. Let's go!
Let's get out ofhere!

1053
01:50:19,367 --> 01:50:21,443
Let's go!
Come on!

1054
01:50:43,726 --> 01:50:47,511
Well, you tell that son of a bitch
this is a Bright Boy Alert.

1055
01:50:47,606 --> 01:50:50,179
I repeat:
A Bright Boy Alert.

1056
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:52,564
This is not a drill.
Do you understand that?

1057
01:50:52,653 --> 01:50:55,570
Hold on.
Put me through to the White House.

1058
01:50:55,656 --> 01:51:00,118
The minimum safe distance is 1 2 miles.
Get the marine patrol in right away.

1059
01:51:00,203 --> 01:51:02,528
I want the Coast Guard
and the sheriff's department too.

1060
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:06,206
Anyone that cannot make that distance,
you gotta get 'em out by air.

1061
01:51:06,293 --> 01:51:09,708
You've got exactly 34 minutes.

1062
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:12,418
I can get you two Marine Corps Harriers
here in 1 1 minutes.

1063
01:51:12,508 --> 01:51:15,213
- They're on manoeuvres outside Key West.
- Get them.

1064
01:51:15,302 --> 01:51:17,840
- I'll briefthem on the way in.
- Send 'em in right away.

1065
01:51:29,151 --> 01:51:31,641
Would you like one?

1066
01:51:38,077 --> 01:51:41,446
I want the state police driving through
the streets on their damn loudspeakers.

1067
01:51:41,539 --> 01:51:43,330
Here they come.

1068
01:51:53,218 --> 01:51:57,216
Lime-Zero-One, got a tally on
three truck,s eastbound on the bridge.

1069
01:51:57,305 --> 01:52:00,011
Roger, Lime-Zero-One.
You're clear to engage.

1070
01:52:00,101 --> 01:52:03,470
Ringo is padlocked.
In hot with guns.

1071
01:52:03,562 --> 01:52:06,019
Let's get some.

1072
01:53:09,216 --> 01:53:10,710
Ok,ay, marines, time to k,ick, ass.

1073
01:53:10,801 --> 01:53:13,672
Recommend using your Mavericks
to take out the bridge.

1074
01:53:13,762 --> 01:53:17,595
Rogerthat.
Lime flight, switch Maverick,s. Two.

1075
01:53:17,683 --> 01:53:20,009
These missiles won't
set off those nukes, will they?

1076
01:53:20,103 --> 01:53:22,428
That's a negative.

1077
01:53:25,609 --> 01:53:28,016
Fire.

1078
01:53:48,300 --> 01:53:50,339
- Bingo!
- Good shooting, marines.

1079
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:43,597
I'll kill you!

1080
01:55:01,628 --> 01:55:04,167
- It's out of control.
- Somebody capped the driver.

1081
01:55:11,680 --> 01:55:13,010
Bitch!

1082
01:55:43,423 --> 01:55:45,997
Like one?
How about two?

1083
01:56:12,579 --> 01:56:14,572
Get down to the limo!

1084
01:56:17,668 --> 01:56:20,539
Come on!
Take it down! Let's go!

1085
01:56:21,631 --> 01:56:24,632
- Get down!
- Take it down.

1086
01:56:33,769 --> 01:56:37,054
- The bridge is out!
- What?

1087
01:56:37,147 --> 01:56:40,149
The bridge is out!

1088
01:56:40,233 --> 01:56:42,227
I can't hearyou!

1089
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:43,861
What?

1090
01:56:46,907 --> 01:56:49,743
Oh, God!
The bridge is out!

1091
01:56:52,581 --> 01:56:54,739
Come on! Come on!

1092
01:56:54,833 --> 01:56:57,407
Speed up a little bit, now.
Get down there.

1093
01:57:05,803 --> 01:57:07,428
Come on! Hurry!

1094
01:57:07,514 --> 01:57:09,506
Hurry, Harry!

1095
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:12,849
- Grab my hand!
- Come back!

1096
01:57:12,936 --> 01:57:16,636
- Okay, to the right.
- I can't reach! Get lower!

1097
01:57:26,617 --> 01:57:29,024
Here we go!
Hold on!

1098
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:31,160
Hold on really tight!

1099
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:37,919
Harry! Come back!

1100
01:57:38,004 --> 01:57:39,464
Pull up!

1101
01:57:42,551 --> 01:57:44,839
Grab my hand!
You can do it!

1102
01:57:44,928 --> 01:57:47,301
I can't reach!

1103
01:57:49,558 --> 01:57:51,930
Oh, God! Please!
Harry!

1104
01:57:56,399 --> 01:57:57,810
Oh, shit.

1105
01:57:59,069 --> 01:58:01,026
Come on, baby.

1106
01:58:08,412 --> 01:58:09,822
Hold on!

1107
01:58:09,913 --> 01:58:11,408
I gotyou!

1108
01:58:11,498 --> 01:58:14,914
- Oh, God!
- Hold on tight!

1109
01:58:48,079 --> 01:58:51,448
Let's get this thing on the ground.

1110
01:59:00,092 --> 01:59:02,132
Let'sget these aircraft
on the ground.

1111
01:59:02,220 --> 01:59:05,422
We got a nuclearbomb going off
in about one minute.

1112
01:59:09,227 --> 01:59:11,718
Any minute now.
Go, go, go.

1113
01:59:11,814 --> 01:59:14,386
Come here.
Give me a bullhorn.

1114
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,395
All right, it's show time.

1115
01:59:18,486 --> 01:59:21,357
Do not look at the flash.
Do not look at the flash!

1116
01:59:23,116 --> 01:59:25,109
We should be safe here.

1117
01:59:34,128 --> 01:59:36,880
This is the wrong finger.

1118
02:00:15,382 --> 02:00:16,792
Come here!

1119
02:00:17,842 --> 02:00:19,502
- Go to work.
- Okay. Bye.

1120
02:00:22,389 --> 02:00:26,304
Aziz's copter landed about 20 minutes
ago on top of a high-rise in Miami.

1121
02:00:26,394 --> 02:00:30,094
He rendezvoused with some faction
members. They're on the 20th floor.

1122
02:00:30,188 --> 02:00:33,605
I got SWAT down there.
The cops cordoned offthe area.

1123
02:00:33,693 --> 02:00:36,183
They got a hostage.
It's Dana.

1124
02:00:37,947 --> 02:00:40,320
What do you mean?
My Dana?

1125
02:00:40,408 --> 02:00:42,401
I'm real sorry.
I don't know what to say.

1126
02:00:42,494 --> 02:00:44,652
I guess he grabbed her
in the middle ofthe night.

1127
02:00:44,746 --> 02:00:46,739
We just found out about it.

1128
02:00:46,831 --> 02:00:49,121
But I don't wantyou to worry.
We'll get her back.

1129
02:00:49,210 --> 02:00:51,203
I've got a guy on the inside.
Listen.

1130
02:00:51,295 --> 02:00:53,833
We're gonna get her back.
Here we go.

1131
02:00:56,509 --> 02:00:59,628
Excuse me, Captain. I got to
borrow your plane for a minute.

1132
02:00:59,721 --> 02:01:03,801
Listen, Force Comm cleared you
to give us total cooperation, right?

1133
02:01:03,891 --> 02:01:06,846
And you know that comes directly from
the president ofthese United States.

1134
02:01:06,936 --> 02:01:09,606
But, sir, you're gonna have
to sign for this aircraft.

1135
02:01:09,690 --> 02:01:12,774
I'll sign for it. You got a pen?
You take care ofit.

1136
02:01:13,777 --> 02:01:15,935
Doyou realize
it has been ten years...

1137
02:01:16,029 --> 02:01:18,022
sinceyou've been behind
the wheel of one ofthese?

1138
02:01:18,116 --> 02:01:20,523
I break it,
they can take it out of my pay.

1139
02:01:20,618 --> 02:01:23,536
Listen, we got a guy on the inside.

1140
02:01:30,503 --> 02:01:33,789
Gotta move back, everybody!
Let's go!

1141
02:01:49,649 --> 02:01:51,807
All right, everybody,
it's gonna be all right!

1142
02:01:54,071 --> 02:01:56,644
He's got hundreds ofhours
in the Harriers there.

1143
02:02:00,702 --> 02:02:04,831
He is a little rusty,
but that's a trademarkTasker takeoff.

1144
02:02:04,915 --> 02:02:08,119
It's like riding a bike.
You never forget, really.

1145
02:02:11,422 --> 02:02:14,874
We might wanna seek shelter!

1146
02:02:18,304 --> 02:02:20,676
Sorry.

1147
02:02:21,391 --> 02:02:22,768
Fuck!

1148
02:02:43,373 --> 02:02:48,201
The streets are filled with people
aspolice try to evacuate the buildings.

1149
02:02:48,295 --> 02:02:51,130
They appearto be shooting
wildly into the air as I'm speak,ing.

1150
02:02:51,215 --> 02:02:53,255
These seem to be warning shots.
So far...

1151
02:02:53,342 --> 02:02:55,668
they have not fired at us orpolice.

1152
02:02:55,886 --> 02:02:57,760
This apparently is the same group...

1153
02:02:57,847 --> 02:03:00,173
which just detonated a nuclear bomb
in the Florida Keys.

1154
02:03:00,266 --> 02:03:04,680
Crimson Jihad will rain fire
on one major U.S. city each week,...

1155
02:03:04,772 --> 02:03:07,809
until our demands are met.

1156
02:03:07,900 --> 02:03:11,732
This tape was released to the media
just minutes after the terrorists--

1157
02:03:11,820 --> 02:03:15,024
I have to go to the bathroom.

1158
02:03:15,116 --> 02:03:19,327
We'll repeat the tape following
this live report from the scene.

1159
02:03:22,915 --> 02:03:24,660
Hold your fire!

1160
02:03:24,751 --> 02:03:27,076
- The video crew you wanted is here!
- Send them!

1161
02:03:30,257 --> 02:03:32,630
They're coming in.
They're unarmed.

1162
02:03:49,361 --> 02:03:51,188
Come on. Let's go.

1163
02:03:51,279 --> 02:03:52,987
Go.

1164
02:03:58,455 --> 02:04:01,905
This is a communique
from Crimson Jihad.

1165
02:04:01,999 --> 02:04:05,251
You have seen a demonstration
of our power.

1166
02:04:05,337 --> 02:04:07,662
Do not force us
to destroy this city...

1167
02:04:07,755 --> 02:04:09,831
and do not try
to use force against us.

1168
02:04:09,924 --> 02:04:13,044
I, we are all prepared to die.

1169
02:04:13,136 --> 02:04:16,256
With one turn ofthat key...

1170
02:04:16,348 --> 02:04:20,132
two million ofyour people
will die instantly!

1171
02:04:20,228 --> 02:04:23,014
- What key?
- That key!

1172
02:04:23,105 --> 02:04:24,896
Who's taken the key?

1173
02:04:31,156 --> 02:04:33,113
Shoot her!

1174
02:04:58,310 --> 02:05:00,054
Holy shit!

1175
02:05:32,096 --> 02:05:35,216
Unit One to Unit Seven.
Give me a situation report.

1176
02:05:35,307 --> 02:05:38,226
One to Seven. Give me a sit rep.
Faisil, do you copy?

1177
02:05:39,687 --> 02:05:41,763
Seven here.
2 1 st floor secure.

1178
02:05:41,857 --> 02:05:45,557
About 1 2 faction members
on the 20th floor. No hostages there.

1179
02:05:45,651 --> 02:05:47,727
- Where's Dana?
- She's on the roof.

1180
02:05:47,821 --> 02:05:50,442
Ok,ay, stayput.
Give me that address again.

1181
02:05:56,998 --> 02:05:58,790
You shoot me, this'll fall!

1182
02:06:01,419 --> 02:06:04,171
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

1183
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:11,256
- Give me the key!
- I'll drop it, I swear!

1184
02:06:15,768 --> 02:06:18,010
Give me the key.

1185
02:06:18,103 --> 02:06:21,307
Come on, child.
You don't want to die, doyou?

1186
02:06:23,567 --> 02:06:27,648
Give me the key
and you won't get hurt.

1187
02:06:27,739 --> 02:06:29,862
I giveyou my word!

1188
02:06:31,076 --> 02:06:33,199
No way, you wacko!

1189
02:06:38,458 --> 02:06:40,950
Help me!

1190
02:07:31,433 --> 02:07:33,509
Please don't come any closer!

1191
02:07:36,312 --> 02:07:38,056
Help me! Help me!

1192
02:07:38,147 --> 02:07:39,607
Somebody!

1193
02:07:51,704 --> 02:07:53,447
Dana,jump down!

1194
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:55,081
Jump down!

1195
02:07:55,666 --> 02:07:57,126
Dad?

1196
02:08:05,677 --> 02:08:07,302
Help me!

1197
02:08:42,758 --> 02:08:45,001
Daddy, come back!

1198
02:08:49,934 --> 02:08:52,092
Daddy, get me down!

1199
02:08:56,648 --> 02:08:58,724
Jump!Jump!

1200
02:08:58,817 --> 02:09:00,442
Daddywill catch you!

1201
02:09:00,528 --> 02:09:02,686
-Jump!
- I can't!

1202
02:09:07,035 --> 02:09:08,197
Hold on!

1203
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:20,211
Don'tyou let me fall, please!

1204
02:09:20,299 --> 02:09:22,338
- Daddy!
- I gotyou!

1205
02:09:22,426 --> 02:09:23,505
I'm slipping!

1206
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:30,133
Help me!
I'm gonna fall!

1207
02:09:36,607 --> 02:09:38,268
Hold my hand!

1208
02:09:42,281 --> 02:09:44,606
Hold on tight, honey.

1209
02:10:39,676 --> 02:10:41,715
He's behind you!

1210
02:10:43,054 --> 02:10:46,470
Take this plane down, now!
I'll kill her!

1211
02:10:46,558 --> 02:10:49,346
Take it down, now!

1212
02:11:06,162 --> 02:11:08,239
My God, do something!

1213
02:11:15,547 --> 02:11:17,540
You're fired.

1214
02:12:03,557 --> 02:12:05,799
It's okay.

1215
02:12:08,604 --> 02:12:10,597
Honey, it's over.

1216
02:12:19,658 --> 02:12:21,318
Hi, pumpkin.

1217
02:12:24,872 --> 02:12:26,865
Just seconds afterthejet landed...

1218
02:12:26,957 --> 02:12:30,658
the unidentifiedpilot was escorted
from the scene by Federal agents.

1219
02:12:30,753 --> 02:12:33,873
Though it is unclear at this moment
which agency was responsible...

1220
02:12:33,965 --> 02:12:36,455
for the operation which ended
the terrorist threat...

1221
02:12:36,551 --> 02:12:38,590
so dramatically
early this morning...

1222
02:12:38,677 --> 02:12:40,670
we've learned from Miami Police--

1223
02:12:48,397 --> 02:12:50,971
Do it properly.

1224
02:12:51,066 --> 02:12:55,444
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

1225
02:12:55,530 --> 02:12:58,697
Five, six, seven, eight,
try to keep your thumbs straight.

1226
02:12:58,784 --> 02:13:00,574
Don't! Stop it!

1227
02:13:00,661 --> 02:13:03,661
- Wait!
- I got you!

1228
02:13:03,747 --> 02:13:06,665
Just listen.
Listen to the rules.

1229
02:13:11,546 --> 02:13:14,917
- Hello?
- Boris and Doris?

1230
02:13:15,009 --> 02:13:16,752
We're on.

1231
02:13:18,512 --> 02:13:20,505
Yes? Go ahead.

1232
02:13:48,169 --> 02:13:50,162
Colonel, how nice to see you again.

1233
02:13:50,255 --> 02:13:52,580
Good evening.

1234
02:13:52,675 --> 02:13:54,502
Who was that?

1235
02:14:03,687 --> 02:14:06,307
What's the scoop, team?
You see your contact yet?

1236
02:14:06,398 --> 02:14:09,731
Haven't seen him yet.

1237
02:14:09,818 --> 02:14:12,605
But I see somebody
I'd like to say hello to.

1238
02:14:12,696 --> 02:14:14,902
Let me pouryou
some more champagne.

1239
02:14:14,989 --> 02:14:17,316
I got to keep up the waiter bit.

1240
02:14:17,409 --> 02:14:19,947
These stakeouts can be tricky.

1241
02:14:20,037 --> 02:14:23,536
You never know when things might
explode into a life-or-death situation.

1242
02:14:23,624 --> 02:14:26,993
If it gets rough, stay low until
it's over and I'll contactyou later.

1243
02:14:27,085 --> 02:14:31,583
- Maybeyou should give meyour--
- So, we meet again, Carlos.

1244
02:14:35,011 --> 02:14:37,632
Honey, I'm just gonna
do him right here, okay?

1245
02:14:37,723 --> 02:14:39,265
Go for it.

1246
02:14:40,684 --> 02:14:42,392
