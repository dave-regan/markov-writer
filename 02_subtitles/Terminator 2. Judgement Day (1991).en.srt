00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,242
Three billion human lives ended
on August 29, 1997.

3
00:01:18,436 --> 00:01:20,705
The survivors of the nuclear fire...

4
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,391
called the war "Judgment Day."

5
00:01:23,428 --> 00:01:26,428
They lived only to face
a new nightmare-

6
00:01:26,468 --> 00:01:28,443
the war against the machines.

7
00:02:43,394 --> 00:02:47,039
The computer which controlled
the machines, Skynet...

8
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:49,976
sent two Terminators
back through time.

9
00:02:50,018 --> 00:02:53,946
Their mission.: to destroy the leader
of the human resistance.

10
00:02:53,987 --> 00:02:56,507
John Connor, my son.

11
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:02,775
The first Terminator was programmed
to strike at me...

12
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:04,728
in the year 1984...

13
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,039
before John was born.

14
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:08,863
It failed.

15
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,680
The second was set to strike
at John himself...

16
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:14,103
when he was still a child.

17
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:21,244
As before, the resistance was able
to send a lone warrior...

18
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:23,518
a protector for John.

19
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,849
It was just a question of which one
of them would reach him first.

20
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:34,231
I need your clothes, your boots
and your motorcycle.

21
00:07:42,557 --> 00:07:44,924
You forgot to say please.

22
00:07:59,965 --> 00:08:01,590
Get him off me!

23
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,222
Pull it out!

24
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,042
Take it.

25
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,979
Can't let you take
the man's wheels, son.

26
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,769
Now, get off
before I put you down.

27
00:09:24,283 --> 00:09:26,585
That's it, goddamn it.

28
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:26,870
R-31 David, Sherman Code 6...

29
00:10:26,905 --> 00:10:30,702
at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe
on electrical disturbance.

30
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,877
Ten-four, R-31 David.

31
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:09,646
John, get in there and clean up
that pigsty of yours.

32
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,834
Your foster parents
are kind of dicks, huh?

33
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:26,100
I swear, I have had it
with that goddamn kid.

34
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,721
- He won't even answer me anymore.
- Honey, move.

35
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,607
Would you get off your butt
and help me?

36
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,389
- Todd!
- What?

37
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:37,685
He hasn't cleaned that room of his
in a month.

38
00:12:37,719 --> 00:12:40,752
Oh, it's an emergency.
Hang on. I'll get right on it.

39
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:49,842
Come on.

40
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:53,011
Get your ass inside.
Do what your mother tells you.

41
00:12:54,071 --> 00:12:56,788
She's not my mother, Todd.

42
00:13:22,198 --> 00:13:23,824
This next patient is interesting.

43
00:13:23,862 --> 00:13:26,251
I've been following the case
for years.

44
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:28,334
A 29-year-old female...

45
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:33,136
diagnosed as acute
schizo-affective disorder.

46
00:13:33,174 --> 00:13:36,338
The usual indicators: depression,
anxiety, violent acting out...

47
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:38,065
delusions of persecution.

48
00:13:44,182 --> 00:13:47,473
The delusional architecture
is fairly unique.

49
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:50,256
She believes that a machine
called the Terminator...

50
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,040
which looks human,
was sent back through time...

51
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:55,592
- to kill her.
- That's original.

52
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:58,764
And also that the father
of her child...

53
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:01,997
was a soldier sent back
to protect her.

54
00:14:02,032 --> 00:14:03,920
He was from the future too.

55
00:14:03,952 --> 00:14:08,425
The year 2029,
if I remember correctly.

56
00:14:08,465 --> 00:14:10,603
And here we are.

57
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:12,424
Morning, Sarah.

58
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:20,367
Good morning, Dr. Silberman.
How's the knee?

59
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:24,015
Fine, Sarah.

60
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,276
She stabbed me in the kneecap...

61
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,727
with my pen a few weeks ago.

62
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:32,197
Repeated escape attempts.

63
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:44,270
Let's move on, shall we?

64
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:47,532
I don't like to see the patients
disrupting their rooms like this.

65
00:14:47,568 --> 00:14:50,991
- See she takes her Thorazine.
- Sure. I'll take care of it.

66
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:06,023
It's time to take your meds, Connor.

67
00:15:06,063 --> 00:15:07,754
You take it.

68
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,221
Now you know you gotta be good...

69
00:15:09,263 --> 00:15:11,051
because you're up for review
this afternoon.

70
00:15:11,087 --> 00:15:14,796
I'm not taking it, Dougie.
I don't want any trouble.

71
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:15,911
Ain't no trouble.

72
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:22,983
Yeah, zap her.

73
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:35,077
Last call, sugar.

74
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,757
Sweet dreams.

75
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,677
Are you the legal guardian
of John Connor?

76
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,647
That's right, Offiicer.
What's he done now?

77
00:16:16,683 --> 00:16:19,552
- Could I speak with him, please?
- You could if he were here.

78
00:16:19,595 --> 00:16:22,377
He took off on his bike this morning.
He could be anywhere.

79
00:16:22,411 --> 00:16:24,680
Do you have a photograph of John?

80
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:25,925
Yeah. Hold on.

81
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:30,917
Gonna tell me what this is about?

82
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,443
I just need to ask him
a few questions.

83
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:38,249
He's a good-looking boy.
Do you mind if I keep this picture?

84
00:16:38,283 --> 00:16:41,666
No, go on. There was a guy here
this morning looking for him too.

85
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,845
Yeah, a big guy on a bike.

86
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,250
Has that got something
to do with this?

87
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:52,418
I wouldn't worry about him.

88
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:55,208
Thanks for your cooperation.

89
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,047
Please insert your stolen card now.

90
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:07,685
PIN number.

91
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:10,403
Hurry up. This is taking too long.

92
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:11,904
Go, baby.

93
00:17:13,386 --> 00:17:14,815
All right.

94
00:17:14,858 --> 00:17:18,470
- PIN number 9003.
- Where'd you learn this stuff from?

95
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,927
From my mom.
My real mom, I mean.

96
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,094
Withdraw 300 bucks.

97
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:27,846
Come on, baby. Come on!

98
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:30,086
- Yes!
- Hey, it worked.

99
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,150
All right. Easy money.
Come on!

100
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:38,078
Yes! Piece of cake.

101
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,144
- Is that her?
- Yes.

102
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:48,004
She's pretty cool, huh?

103
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:50,241
No, she's a complete psycho.

104
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:52,896
That's why she's at Pescadero.
It's a mental institute.

105
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:57,501
She tried to blow up a computer factory
but got shot and arrested.

106
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,549
No shit.

107
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:02,564
She's a total loser.

108
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:05,216
Come on.
Let's go spend some money.

109
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:32,161
Sarah...

110
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:34,948
Sarah, wake up.

111
00:18:41,733 --> 00:18:43,391
Kyle.

112
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:47,330
You're dead.

113
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,339
Where's our son, Sarah?

114
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:52,481
They took him away from me.

115
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:55,615
- He's the target now.
- I know.

116
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,692
He's all alone
and you have to protect him.

117
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,100
I know.

118
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:02,652
You tell me
how I'm supposed to do that.

119
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:04,798
He doesn't even believe me anymore.

120
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:08,731
- I've lost him.
- You're strong, Sarah.

121
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,161
Stronger than you ever thought
you could be.

122
00:19:12,101 --> 00:19:13,530
On your feet, soldier!

123
00:19:15,492 --> 00:19:16,899
I love you, Sarah.

124
00:19:16,932 --> 00:19:19,136
I always will.

125
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:21,501
I need you.

126
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,199
I'll always be with you.

127
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,298
Remember the message?

128
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,129
The future is not set.

129
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:36,641
There is no fate
but what we make for ourselves.

130
00:19:55,811 --> 00:19:57,698
Stay with me.

131
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,347
There's not much time left
in the world, Sarah.

132
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,233
Kyle, don't go!

133
00:20:21,891 --> 00:20:23,833
Kyle!

134
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:36,215
It's like a giant strobe light...

135
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:38,526
burning right through my eyes.

136
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:44,759
Somehow I can still see.

137
00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:52,125
Oh, God.

138
00:21:55,425 --> 00:21:58,781
We know the dream's the same
every night.

139
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:02,076
- Why do I have to-
- Please continue.

140
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,281
Children look like burnt paper.

141
00:22:09,822 --> 00:22:11,895
Black.

142
00:22:11,935 --> 00:22:13,822
Not moving.

143
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,885
And then the blast wave hits them.

144
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:29,401
And they fly apart like leaves.

145
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:32,150
Dreams...

146
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,329
of cataclysm,
the end of the world...

147
00:22:34,366 --> 00:22:36,254
are very common.

148
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:41,945
It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.

149
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:45,811
- I know the date it happens.
- I'm sure it feels real to you.

150
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:48,275
On August 29, 1997...

151
00:22:48,317 --> 00:22:51,732
it's gonna feel
pretty fuckin'real to you too!

152
00:22:51,774 --> 00:22:56,246
Anybody not wearing two-million
sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.

153
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:57,268
Get it?

154
00:22:57,309 --> 00:23:00,091
God, you think
you're safe and alive.

155
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,362
You're already dead. Everybody!

156
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:04,853
Him. You. You're dead already.

157
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:07,708
This whole place,
everything you see is gone!

158
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:11,669
You're the one living in the dream,
'cause I know it happened!

159
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,596
It happened!

160
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:27,060
I feel much better now.

161
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:28,956
Clearer.

162
00:23:28,988 --> 00:23:31,705
Yes, your attitude has been...

163
00:23:31,741 --> 00:23:33,977
much improved lately.

164
00:23:42,877 --> 00:23:45,299
It's helped me to have a goal...

165
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:48,472
something to look forward to.

166
00:23:48,508 --> 00:23:49,621
What is that?

167
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,962
Well, you said...

168
00:23:51,996 --> 00:23:55,738
that if I showed improvement
after six months...

169
00:23:55,772 --> 00:23:58,358
you would transfer me
to the minimum security wing...

170
00:23:58,396 --> 00:24:01,079
and I could have visitors.

171
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,076
Well, it's been six months...

172
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:06,523
and...

173
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,784
I was looking forward
to seeing my son.

174
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,667
I see.

175
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,319
Let's go back to what you were saying
about those Terminator machines.

176
00:24:20,412 --> 00:24:23,707
Now you think they don't exist?

177
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:26,042
They don't exist.

178
00:24:26,076 --> 00:24:27,734
I know that now.

179
00:24:27,772 --> 00:24:30,838
But you've told me on many occasions
about how you crushed one...

180
00:24:30,876 --> 00:24:32,916
in a hydraulic press.

181
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:37,237
If I had, there would have
been some evidence.

182
00:24:37,276 --> 00:24:39,643
They would have found something
at the factory.

183
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:41,748
I see.

184
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:45,083
So you don't believe anymore
that the company covered it up?

185
00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:50,041
No. Why would they?

186
00:24:50,076 --> 00:24:53,235
Let's try a new position
right there.

187
00:25:02,715 --> 00:25:05,944
Mr. Dyson?

188
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,532
The materials team
is running another-

189
00:25:08,571 --> 00:25:10,197
- Mr. Dyson.
- Yes?

190
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:13,137
The materials team is running
another series this afternoon.

191
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:16,048
You have to sign for the- it.

192
00:25:16,091 --> 00:25:18,841
- You have to sign it out.
- Okay. I'll get it.

193
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,628
I know I haven't been here long,
but I was wondering if you know-

194
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:26,008
Know what?

195
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:28,628
If you know where "it" came from.

196
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:31,983
I asked them the same question once.
You know what they told me?

197
00:25:32,026 --> 00:25:33,914
Don't ask.

198
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,513
- Good morning, Mr. Dyson.
- How's it going?

199
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:45,424
Insert key.
Left on three.

200
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:47,735
Two, one, turn.

201
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,749
- How are the wife and kids?
- Great. Thanks.

202
00:26:19,738 --> 00:26:22,776
So what do you think, Doctor?

203
00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:25,497
Haven't I shown improvement?

204
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:29,399
Well, Sarah, here's the problem.

205
00:26:30,425 --> 00:26:32,792
I know how smart you are.

206
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,767
You're just telling me
what I want to hear.

207
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,737
I don't think you really believe
what you're telling me today.

208
00:26:38,777 --> 00:26:42,519
If I put you in minimum security,
you'll just try to escape again.

209
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:49,397
You have to let me see my son.

210
00:26:50,553 --> 00:26:52,113
Please.

211
00:26:55,897 --> 00:26:58,995
He's in great danger.
He's naked without me.

212
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:01,742
If I could make a phone call-

213
00:27:01,785 --> 00:27:04,174
I'm afraid not.
Not for a while.

214
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:08,685
I don't see any choice but to
recommend to the review board...

215
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:11,183
that you stay here
for another six months.

216
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:17,396
I'll kill you,
you son of a bitch!

217
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,280
You son of a bitch!

218
00:27:21,689 --> 00:27:25,431
Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!

219
00:27:25,464 --> 00:27:26,926
You don't know what you're doing!

220
00:27:26,968 --> 00:27:29,040
Get some restraints in here now!

221
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:33,617
You don't know what you're doing!

222
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,509
Model citizen.

223
00:28:16,887 --> 00:28:19,538
You just missed him.
He was here 15 minutes ago.

224
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:22,674
- He was going to the galleria.
- Yeah.

225
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,435
The galleria?

226
00:29:07,766 --> 00:29:10,865
I'm gonna get some quarters.
I'll be back, all right?

227
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:27,891
- Oh, no!
- Girls, do you know John Connor?

228
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,130
Hey, do you know this guy?

229
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,271
Nah, I don't know him.

230
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,700
- John.
- Not now.

231
00:29:43,733 --> 00:29:46,897
There's this cop scoping for you.
Check it out.

232
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,189
- He's right over there.
- Split, man.

233
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,610
- Just go.
- Yeah.

234
00:29:58,101 --> 00:29:59,312
I saw that kid-

235
00:30:14,005 --> 00:30:15,892
You're not supposed to
be in here!

236
00:30:40,532 --> 00:30:41,710
Get down.

237
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,660
Mister, are you all right?

238
00:31:52,787 --> 00:31:53,932
You all right?

239
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:09,773
Come on!

240
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:49,393
Goddamn!

241
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:19,688
Okay, time-out.
Stop the bike.

242
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:22,245
Time out.
Come on, stop the bike.

243
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:37,416
Holy shit.
Now, don't take this the wrong way.

244
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,787
- You are a Terminator, right?
- Yes.

245
00:37:39,821 --> 00:37:42,538
Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.

246
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:55,532
Holy shit.

247
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,461
You're really real.

248
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,387
I mean-

249
00:38:03,756 --> 00:38:06,658
You're like a machine underneath,
right?

250
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,162
But alive outside?

251
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,092
I'm a cybernetic organism.

252
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:12,742
Living tissue
over metal endoskeleton.

253
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:29,062
This is intense.

254
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,783
Get a grip, John. Okay.

255
00:38:34,251 --> 00:38:36,324
You're not here to kill me.

256
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:40,193
I fiigured that part out for myself.
So what's the deal?

257
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,886
My mission is to protect you.

258
00:38:42,924 --> 00:38:45,477
Yeah? Who sent you?

259
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:47,749
You did.

260
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:49,926
Thirty-fiive years from now,
you reprogrammed me...

261
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:52,127
to be your protector here,
in this time.

262
00:38:52,712 --> 00:38:55,462
Oh, this is deep.

263
00:39:16,808 --> 00:39:19,393
So this other guy, he's
a Terminator like you, right?

264
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:23,360
Not like me.
A T-1000, advanced prototype.

265
00:39:24,871 --> 00:39:26,627
More advanced than you are?

266
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,249
Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.

267
00:39:29,288 --> 00:39:31,044
What the hell does that mean?

268
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,966
Liquid metal.

269
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,203
Where are we going?

270
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,989
We have to get out of the city
immediately and avoid the authorities.

271
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:41,185
I gotta stop by my house.
I wanna pick up some stuff.

272
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:45,826
Negative. The T-1000 would defiinitely
try to reacquire you there.

273
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,550
- You sure?
- I would.

274
00:39:58,693 --> 00:40:01,279
Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...

275
00:40:03,429 --> 00:40:04,858
but I gotta warn 'em.

276
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:07,235
Shit. You got a quarter?

277
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:18,524
- Hello.
- Janelle, it's me.

278
00:40:18,565 --> 00:40:20,867
- John?
- Is everything all right?

279
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,267
- Are you guys okay?
- Sure, honey, everything's okay.

280
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:26,301
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

281
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,821
John, it's late.
I was beginning to worry about you.

282
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,479
If you hurry home, we can sit down
and have dinner together.

283
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,044
I'm making beef stew.

284
00:40:34,085 --> 00:40:36,954
Something's wrong.
She's never this nice.

285
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:38,720
Where are you?

286
00:40:38,756 --> 00:40:41,571
What the hell is
the goddamn dog barking at?

287
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,768
Hey, shut up,
you worthless piece of shit!

288
00:40:44,804 --> 00:40:46,298
The dog's really barking.

289
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,479
You were gonna tell the kid
to get rid of that mutt.

290
00:40:52,164 --> 00:40:54,848
John, it's late.
Please don't make me worry.

291
00:40:54,884 --> 00:40:56,542
Could he already be there?

292
00:40:57,636 --> 00:40:58,945
Are you okay?

293
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,842
- I'm right here. I'm fiine.
- Are you sure you're all right?

294
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:06,081
- What's the dog's name?
- Max.

295
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,451
Hey, Janelle.
What's wrong with Wolfiie?

296
00:41:08,484 --> 00:41:11,004
I can hear him barking.
Is he okay?

297
00:41:11,044 --> 00:41:14,786
Wolfiie's fiine, honey.
Wolfiie's just fiine.

298
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:16,478
Where are you?

299
00:41:17,955 --> 00:41:19,035
Your foster parents are dead.

300
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:57,273
I need a minute here.

301
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:01,505
You're telling me that this thing
can imitate anything it touches?

302
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:04,387
Anything it samples
by physical contact.

303
00:42:04,419 --> 00:42:05,848
Get real.

304
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:09,536
It could disguise itself
as a pack of cigarettes?

305
00:42:09,571 --> 00:42:11,458
No, only an object
of equal size.

306
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,472
Why not just become a bomb
or something to get me?

307
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,990
It can't form complex machines.

308
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:18,552
Guns and explosives
have chemicals, moving parts.

309
00:42:18,592 --> 00:42:19,933
It doesn't work that way.

310
00:42:19,968 --> 00:42:22,521
- But it can form solid metal shapes.
- Like what?

311
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,600
Knives and stabbing weapons.

312
00:42:53,919 --> 00:42:56,286
These were taken by
a video surveillance camera...

313
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,767
at the West Highland Police Station
in 1984.

314
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,860
He killed 17 police offiicers
that night.

315
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,230
Men with families...

316
00:43:08,703 --> 00:43:10,110
children.

317
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:13,916
These were taken at a mall
in Reseda...

318
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:15,577
today.

319
00:43:17,215 --> 00:43:20,349
Miss Connor, we know you know
who this guy is.

320
00:43:22,942 --> 00:43:27,219
I just sat here and told you
that your son is missing...

321
00:43:27,261 --> 00:43:30,044
that the foster parents
have been murdered.

322
00:43:30,078 --> 00:43:31,704
We know this guy's involved.

323
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:35,994
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Don't you care?

324
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:42,067
We're wasting our time.

325
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:44,182
Let's go.

326
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,709
Sorry, guys.

327
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,874
She's grown more disconnected
from reality as time goes on.

328
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:53,113
I'm afraid she can't help us now.

329
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:56,281
If she clears at all and can
give us anything, I'll call you.

330
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:57,844
Sure.

331
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:00,820
Douglas, take her back to her room.

332
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:01,941
Yes, sir.

333
00:44:03,485 --> 00:44:05,492
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

334
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,606
You see...

335
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,744
we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua
and places like that.

336
00:44:11,868 --> 00:44:16,124
For a while there, she was with
this crazy ex-Green Beret guy...

337
00:44:16,157 --> 00:44:17,499
running guns.

338
00:44:17,532 --> 00:44:20,402
Then there were some other guys.

339
00:44:20,445 --> 00:44:22,387
She'd shack up with anybody
she could learn from...

340
00:44:22,428 --> 00:44:25,527
so she could teach me how to be
this great military leader.

341
00:44:27,228 --> 00:44:29,203
Then she gets busted.

342
00:44:29,244 --> 00:44:32,724
It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's
a psycho. Didn't you know?"

343
00:44:34,845 --> 00:44:38,587
Like everything I've been brought up
to believe is all made-up bullshit.

344
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:41,206
I hated her for that.

345
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:46,903
But everything she said was true.

346
00:44:48,124 --> 00:44:50,012
She knew...

347
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:54,100
and nobody believed her...

348
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,627
not even me.

349
00:44:59,452 --> 00:45:01,307
Listen. We gotta get her
out of there.

350
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:04,569
Negative. The T-1000's highest
probability for success now...

351
00:45:04,604 --> 00:45:07,571
will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait
for you to make contact with her.

352
00:45:07,612 --> 00:45:09,652
Great. What happens to her?

353
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:12,507
Typically, the subject being copied
is terminated.

354
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,671
Shit! Why didn't you tell me?
We gotta go right now!

355
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,748
Negative.
It's not a mission priority.

356
00:45:17,788 --> 00:45:19,893
Fuck you!
She's a priority to me!

357
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:25,521
Goddamn it!
What's your problem? Help!

358
00:45:25,564 --> 00:45:27,352
This does not help our mission.

359
00:45:27,388 --> 00:45:29,777
Get this psycho off of me!
Help!

360
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,787
I'm being kidnapped!
Get this psycho off of me!

361
00:45:32,827 --> 00:45:33,842
Let me go!

362
00:45:38,171 --> 00:45:39,927
Why did you do that?

363
00:45:39,963 --> 00:45:41,818
Because you told me to.

364
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:45,914
What?

365
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,657
You have to do what I say?

366
00:45:52,699 --> 00:45:54,870
That's one of my mission parameters.

367
00:45:56,027 --> 00:45:59,442
Prove it.
Stand on one foot.

368
00:46:01,402 --> 00:46:02,864
Yes!

369
00:46:04,923 --> 00:46:08,403
Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.

370
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:11,064
You okay, kid?

371
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:12,473
Take a hike, bozo.

372
00:46:12,507 --> 00:46:15,027
Let's get outta here, man.

373
00:46:15,066 --> 00:46:16,889
Fuck you, you little dipshit!

374
00:46:17,594 --> 00:46:19,001
Dipshit?

375
00:46:21,051 --> 00:46:23,123
Put your leg down.

376
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:27,832
- Did you call moi a dipshit?
- Just trying to help this punk.

377
00:46:27,867 --> 00:46:30,136
Grab this guy.

378
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:32,852
Get him off of me!

379
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,930
Now who's the dipshit...

380
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,693
you jock douche bag?

381
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,791
Put the gun down now!

382
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:50,966
- Get outta here!
- Come on. Let's split!

383
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:59,503
You were gonna kill that guy!

384
00:46:59,546 --> 00:47:01,618
Of course. I'm a Terminator.

385
00:47:03,705 --> 00:47:06,291
Listen to me very carefully, okay?

386
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:09,591
You're not a Terminator anymore,
all right?

387
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:11,960
You got that?

388
00:47:11,993 --> 00:47:14,230
You just can't go around
killing people.

389
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,247
Why?

390
00:47:16,185 --> 00:47:18,257
What do you mean, why?
'Cause you can't.

391
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:22,006
Because you just can't.
Trust me on this.

392
00:47:27,769 --> 00:47:31,118
Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.

393
00:47:31,161 --> 00:47:33,911
I order you to help me.

394
00:49:55,383 --> 00:49:57,750
You have a Sarah Connor here?

395
00:49:57,782 --> 00:49:59,375
You're runnin' kind of late.

396
00:49:59,415 --> 00:50:01,803
They've been in there for an hour.

397
00:50:01,847 --> 00:50:04,181
Hold on a second.
I'll buzz you in.

398
00:50:05,846 --> 00:50:09,588
Oh, here come your friends now.

399
00:51:08,821 --> 00:51:12,170
- Gwen, you want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

400
00:51:12,213 --> 00:51:15,082
- How 'bout a beer?
- Yeah, right.

401
00:51:37,972 --> 00:51:41,104
- Hey, I got a full house.
- That's good, Louis.

402
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,376
Must be my lucky day.

403
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:02,694
You're right about number 24.

404
00:54:02,736 --> 00:54:05,638
Increase the medication
to 250 milligrams.

405
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:08,461
- Same kind?
- Mm-hmm.

406
00:54:22,575 --> 00:54:24,909
You!

407
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:29,198
You broke my arm.

408
00:54:29,231 --> 00:54:31,914
There are 215 bones
in the human body.

409
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,472
That's one. Now, don't move.

410
00:54:40,175 --> 00:54:41,768
What are you going to do?

411
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:47,207
Why do we stop now?

412
00:54:48,399 --> 00:54:52,108
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna kill anyone, right?

413
00:54:52,143 --> 00:54:54,663
- Right.
- Swear?

414
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:56,164
What?

415
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:59,206
Just put up your hand and say,
"I swear I won't kill anyone."

416
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:02,573
I swear I will not kill anyone.

417
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,509
All right. Let's go.

418
00:55:10,862 --> 00:55:12,804
Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00...

419
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:15,050
Monday through Friday.

420
00:55:18,574 --> 00:55:19,785
What the hell are you doing?

421
00:55:19,822 --> 00:55:22,342
You son of a bitch!
You shot me!

422
00:55:24,046 --> 00:55:25,355
Crazy bastard!

423
00:55:29,422 --> 00:55:31,626
Don't shoot me again.
Don't kill me.

424
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:36,909
He'll live.

425
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:52,871
Son of a bitch!

426
00:55:54,254 --> 00:55:55,530
Let's try to remain calm.

427
00:55:55,566 --> 00:55:57,453
Open it, or he'll be dead
before he hits the floor.

428
00:55:57,486 --> 00:55:59,493
There's no way, Connor.
Let him go.

429
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:01,988
- Open the door.
- It ain't gonna happen.

430
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,852
Take it easy, Sarah.

431
00:56:03,885 --> 00:56:06,919
It won't work. You're no killer.
I don't believe you can do it.

432
00:56:06,957 --> 00:56:09,859
You're already dead. Everybody dies.
You know I believe it.

433
00:56:09,901 --> 00:56:11,876
So don't fuck with me!

434
00:56:11,917 --> 00:56:13,575
Open the door!

435
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:21,735
Back off!

436
00:56:21,773 --> 00:56:23,180
Get back!

437
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,100
I'll pump him full of this shit.
I swear!

438
00:56:26,381 --> 00:56:28,388
Don't move!

439
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:30,631
Drop the shit!

440
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,491
Do it!

441
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:34,412
Get in the offiice.

442
00:56:34,445 --> 00:56:36,452
On the floor, face down.
Not you!

443
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,151
Open the door.

444
00:56:40,844 --> 00:56:42,251
On the floor. Hold it open.

445
00:56:42,285 --> 00:56:44,172
Face the wall!

446
00:56:59,468 --> 00:57:01,257
Get her!

447
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,689
Hurry up! Open the door!
The door's locked!

448
00:57:31,723 --> 00:57:33,545
Let's go! Open it!

449
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,825
- She broke it off.
- Open it!

450
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:45,224
Let's go around! Come on!
Move it!

451
00:58:16,043 --> 00:58:17,122
Mom, wait!

452
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:24,641
Come back here!

453
00:58:29,067 --> 00:58:30,660
- Help her!
- Wait here.

454
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:33,186
- Hurry up!
- He'll kill us all!

455
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:35,621
Hold her.

456
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,211
He'll kill us all!

457
00:58:59,498 --> 00:59:01,767
Mom, are you okay? Mom!

458
00:59:06,026 --> 00:59:08,393
Come with me
if you want to live.

459
00:59:08,426 --> 00:59:10,881
It's okay, Mom.
He's here to help.

460
00:59:34,538 --> 00:59:35,585
Go.

461
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,024
What the fuck is it?
What the fuck is going on?

462
01:00:23,145 --> 01:00:24,967
Get down.

463
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,894
Out of the car!

464
01:01:02,215 --> 01:01:03,360
Right now!

465
01:01:26,791 --> 01:01:27,773
Go!

466
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:39,745
I'm out.

467
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:48,101
- Come on.
- Here.

468
01:01:50,535 --> 01:01:52,542
Reload.

469
01:02:01,094 --> 01:02:03,004
Last one!

470
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,421
Hang on.

471
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:38,044
Ready!

472
01:02:51,174 --> 01:02:53,028
Here, drive.

473
01:03:44,069 --> 01:03:46,240
He's not back there.
There's nobody behind us.

474
01:03:46,276 --> 01:03:48,164
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

475
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:51,612
Can you see anything?

476
01:03:52,773 --> 01:03:53,950
I see everything.

477
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,269
Cool.

478
01:04:01,732 --> 01:04:03,619
Come here.

479
01:04:09,092 --> 01:04:10,816
I said I was okay.

480
01:04:11,588 --> 01:04:14,555
John, it was stupid of you
to go there.

481
01:04:15,492 --> 01:04:17,696
You have to be smarter
than that.

482
01:04:17,732 --> 01:04:19,293
You were almost killed.

483
01:04:20,452 --> 01:04:22,110
What were you thinking?

484
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:25,533
You cannot risk yourself,
even for me.

485
01:04:25,572 --> 01:04:27,066
Do you understand?

486
01:04:27,108 --> 01:04:28,602
You're too important.

487
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:31,197
Do you understand?

488
01:04:33,956 --> 01:04:35,036
But...

489
01:04:36,643 --> 01:04:40,255
I had to get you out of that place.
I'm sorry.

490
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,421
I didn't need your help.

491
01:04:50,623 --> 01:04:52,150
What's wrong with your eyes?

492
01:04:54,047 --> 01:04:55,453
Nothing.

493
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:07,316
So, what's your story?

494
01:05:17,406 --> 01:05:18,486
You okay?

495
01:05:18,527 --> 01:05:19,933
Fine.

496
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:24,826
Say, that's a nice bike.

497
01:05:46,398 --> 01:05:48,088
Watch it, lug nuts.

498
01:05:55,262 --> 01:05:58,557
Listen, do you know
what you're doing?

499
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:01,273
I have detailed fiiles
on human anatomy.

500
01:06:02,174 --> 01:06:04,083
I bet.

501
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,027
Makes you a more effiicient killer,
right?

502
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:08,149
Correct.

503
01:06:13,981 --> 01:06:15,868
Does it hurt
when you get shot?

504
01:06:16,894 --> 01:06:20,210
I sense injuries.
The data could be called "pain."

505
01:06:22,462 --> 01:06:24,349
John, help me with the light.

506
01:06:24,382 --> 01:06:26,618
- Will these heal up?
- Yes.

507
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:30,712
Good. If you can't pass for human,
you're not much good to us.

508
01:06:30,749 --> 01:06:33,748
How long do you live?
I mean, last. Whatever.

509
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:36,636
A hundred and twenty years
with my existing power cell.

510
01:06:36,669 --> 01:06:39,516
Can you learn stuff that you
haven't been programmed with...

511
01:06:39,549 --> 01:06:40,956
so you can be...

512
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:44,760
you know, more human...

513
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:47,447
and not such a dork
all the time?

514
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,875
My CPU is a neural net processor,
a learning computer.

515
01:06:53,917 --> 01:06:58,107
But Skynet presets the switch
to read-only when we're sent out alone.

516
01:06:59,389 --> 01:07:01,756
Doesn't want you to do
too much thinking, huh?

517
01:07:01,788 --> 01:07:03,065
No.

518
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,744
Can we reset the switch?

519
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:28,338
Rotate the two locking cylinders
counterclockwise.

520
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:35,410
Do it.

521
01:07:43,228 --> 01:07:45,617
Now open the port cover.

522
01:07:48,028 --> 01:07:50,515
Pull to break the seal.

523
01:07:53,467 --> 01:07:57,329
Good, now remove
the shock-damping assembly.

524
01:08:00,699 --> 01:08:03,088
You can now access the CPU.

525
01:08:03,995 --> 01:08:06,134
- Do you see it?
- Yes.

526
01:08:06,171 --> 01:08:09,968
Hold the CPU by its base tab.

527
01:08:10,011 --> 01:08:11,386
Pull.

528
01:08:47,226 --> 01:08:48,917
Do you see the pin switch?

529
01:08:48,954 --> 01:08:50,777
No! No!

530
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:54,260
- Out of my way, John.
- Don't kill him.

531
01:08:54,298 --> 01:08:57,494
It, John, not him.
It.

532
01:08:57,530 --> 01:09:00,912
Okay, it.
But we need it.

533
01:09:00,955 --> 01:09:03,508
Listen to me.
You listen.

534
01:09:03,546 --> 01:09:05,618
We're better-off on our own.

535
01:09:05,659 --> 01:09:07,447
But he's the only proof we have...

536
01:09:07,482 --> 01:09:09,903
of the future and the war
and all that.

537
01:09:09,946 --> 01:09:11,321
Maybe.

538
01:09:13,786 --> 01:09:15,794
I don't trust it.

539
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:17,459
But he's my friend, all right?

540
01:09:18,266 --> 01:09:20,983
You don't know what it's like
to try to kill one of these things...

541
01:09:21,018 --> 01:09:24,466
and if something goes wrong
this could be our last chance, so move!

542
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:26,545
If I'm ever supposed to be this
great military leader...

543
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:30,295
maybe you should start listening
to my leadership ideas once in a while.

544
01:09:33,145 --> 01:09:34,869
Because if my own mother won't...

545
01:09:34,906 --> 01:09:37,623
how do you expect anyone else to?

546
01:09:51,226 --> 01:09:54,193
All right, play it your way.

547
01:10:01,305 --> 01:10:03,312
Was there a problem?

548
01:10:03,353 --> 01:10:04,815
No problem.

549
01:10:06,425 --> 01:10:07,635
None whatsoever.

550
01:10:39,887 --> 01:10:41,775
Are we learning yet?

551
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,526
We have to get as far away
from the city as possible.

552
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:01,639
Just head south.

553
01:11:10,030 --> 01:11:11,591
Keep it under 65.

554
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:14,477
- We don't want to be pulled over.
- Affiirmative.

555
01:11:17,583 --> 01:11:20,004
You gotta listen to the way
people talk.

556
01:11:20,046 --> 01:11:23,462
You don't say "affiirmative"
or some shit like that.

557
01:11:23,502 --> 01:11:25,706
You say, '"No problemo. '"

558
01:11:25,742 --> 01:11:29,539
If someone comes off to you
with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."

559
01:11:29,582 --> 01:11:33,706
And if you want to shine them on,
it's '"Hasta la vista, baby."

560
01:11:34,254 --> 01:11:36,359
Hasta la vista, baby.

561
01:11:36,878 --> 01:11:38,853
Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."

562
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:41,829
If someone gets upset,
you say, "Chill out."

563
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,277
Or you can do combinations.

564
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:46,187
Chill out, dick-wad.

565
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,900
That's great.
See? You're getting it.

566
01:11:49,006 --> 01:11:49,988
No problemo.

567
01:12:00,555 --> 01:12:02,442
You got any cash?

568
01:12:02,475 --> 01:12:05,922
I got a couple hundred bucks.
I'll give you half.

569
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,588
Mom!

570
01:12:08,682 --> 01:12:10,624
Get some food.

571
01:12:12,522 --> 01:12:14,944
No sense of humor.

572
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:23,494
That's another thing.
You can lighten up a bit yourself.

573
01:12:24,362 --> 01:12:26,467
This severe routine
is getting old, okay.

574
01:12:26,506 --> 01:12:28,328
I mean, you're acting
like such a geek.

575
01:12:28,362 --> 01:12:30,304
Smile once in a while.

576
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,687
Smile?

577
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:35,519
Yeah, you know, smile.
Watch.

578
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:40,036
Hi. Nice place you got here.
How's business?

579
01:12:40,906 --> 01:12:42,728
Give me a break.

580
01:12:43,562 --> 01:12:45,504
Okay, bad example.

581
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:48,195
See that guy over there?

582
01:12:48,233 --> 01:12:50,088
That's a smile.

583
01:13:08,617 --> 01:13:10,046
That's good.

584
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:13,766
Maybe you could practice
in front of a mirror or something.

585
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,769
Want some of my fries?

586
01:13:31,337 --> 01:13:33,224
Need any help?

587
01:13:33,257 --> 01:13:34,882
No.

588
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:36,709
- I got you!
- No, you didn't!

589
01:13:44,712 --> 01:13:47,746
We're not gonna make it,
are we?

590
01:13:49,545 --> 01:13:50,755
People, I mean.

591
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:55,555
It's in your nature
to destroy yourselves.

592
01:13:56,552 --> 01:13:59,400
Yeah. Major drag, huh?

593
01:14:00,488 --> 01:14:01,830
Break it up before I wring
both of your necks.

594
01:14:04,262 --> 01:14:07,262
I need to know
how Skynet gets built.

595
01:14:07,302 --> 01:14:08,546
Who's responsible?

596
01:14:08,582 --> 01:14:12,030
The man most directly responsible
is Miles Bennett Dyson.

597
01:14:12,069 --> 01:14:13,760
Who is that?

598
01:14:13,797 --> 01:14:17,594
He's the director of special projects
at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.

599
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,953
Why him?

600
01:14:21,989 --> 01:14:25,251
In a few months he creates
a revolutionary type of microprocessor.

601
01:14:26,246 --> 01:14:27,555
Go on. Then what?

602
01:14:28,582 --> 01:14:31,429
In three years Cyberdyne will become
the largest supplier...

603
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:32,836
of military computer systems.

604
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:36,677
All Stealth bombers are upgraded
with Cyberdyne computers...

605
01:14:36,709 --> 01:14:38,138
becoming fully unmanned.

606
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,149
Afterwards they fly with
a perfect operational record.

607
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:43,775
The Skynet funding bill is passed.

608
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,977
The system goes on-line
on August 4, 1997.

609
01:14:47,013 --> 01:14:50,112
Human decisions are removed
from strategic defense.

610
01:14:50,149 --> 01:14:52,800
Skynet begins to learn
at a geometric rate.

611
01:14:52,837 --> 01:14:56,994
It becomes self-aware
at 2: 14 a. m. Eastern time, August 29.

612
01:14:57,989 --> 01:15:00,510
In a panic,
they try to pull the plug.

613
01:15:01,573 --> 01:15:03,744
- Skynet fiights back.
- Yes.

614
01:15:03,781 --> 01:15:06,464
It launches its missiles
against the targets in Russia.

615
01:15:06,501 --> 01:15:09,468
Why attack Russia?
Aren't they our friends now?

616
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:11,843
Because Skynet knows
that the Russian counterattack...

617
01:15:11,877 --> 01:15:13,764
will eliminate its enemies
over here.

618
01:15:13,797 --> 01:15:15,684
Jesus.

619
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:19,780
How much do you know
about Dyson?

620
01:15:21,796 --> 01:15:23,683
I have detailed fiiles.

621
01:15:24,804 --> 01:15:26,692
I want to know everything.

622
01:15:26,916 --> 01:15:29,185
What he looks like,
where he lives, everything.

623
01:15:42,912 --> 01:15:44,319
Miles.

624
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,502
Miles.

625
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:07,354
Are you going to work all day?

626
01:16:07,391 --> 01:16:11,133
I'm sorry, baby.
But this thing is just kicking my ass.

627
01:16:11,166 --> 01:16:12,476
Miles, it's Sunday.

628
01:16:12,511 --> 01:16:15,162
You promised to take the kids
to Raging Waters today.

629
01:16:16,671 --> 01:16:18,133
I can't...

630
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,376
I'm on a roll.

631
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,874
Baby, this is going
to blow them all away.

632
01:16:34,911 --> 01:16:37,911
- It's a neural net processor.
- I know. You told me.

633
01:16:37,950 --> 01:16:41,016
It's a neural net processor.
It thinks and learns like we do.

634
01:16:41,054 --> 01:16:43,673
It's superconducting
at room temperature.

635
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:47,801
Other computers are just
pocket calculators by comparison.

636
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:51,834
But why is that
so goddamn important, Miles?

637
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:53,179
I really need to know...

638
01:16:53,214 --> 01:16:56,214
because sometimes I feel
like I'm going crazy here.

639
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,732
Baby, I am this close.

640
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:01,748
Come here.

641
01:17:04,254 --> 01:17:06,709
Imagine a jet airliner...

642
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:09,335
with a pilot that never gets tired,
never makes mistakes...

643
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:11,196
never shows up to work
with a hangover.

644
01:17:13,469 --> 01:17:15,836
Meet the pilot.

645
01:17:15,870 --> 01:17:18,870
Why did we get married, Miles?
Why did we have these children?

646
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:19,925
You don't need us.

647
01:17:19,966 --> 01:17:23,315
Your heart and your mind
are in here.

648
01:17:23,358 --> 01:17:26,140
But it doesn't love you
like we do.

649
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:36,470
I'm sorry.
Really.

650
01:17:36,509 --> 01:17:40,633
How about spending some time
with your other babies?

651
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,954
Raging Waters!

652
01:18:13,403 --> 01:18:14,613
Wait in the car.

653
01:18:51,898 --> 01:18:53,556
You're pretty jumpy, Connor.

654
01:19:13,594 --> 01:19:15,154
Hey, big John.

655
01:19:15,866 --> 01:19:16,880
What's up?

656
01:19:18,233 --> 01:19:19,313
He's cool, Enrique.

657
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,433
He's with me.

658
01:19:20,474 --> 01:19:23,540
He's... Uncle Bob.

659
01:19:23,577 --> 01:19:25,617
Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.

660
01:19:25,657 --> 01:19:27,512
Uncle Bob, huh?

661
01:19:28,506 --> 01:19:29,749
Okay.

662
01:19:36,441 --> 01:19:37,423
Drink?

663
01:19:42,425 --> 01:19:43,799
"Uncle Bob"?

664
01:19:45,721 --> 01:19:48,568
You're pretty famous,
all over the goddamn TV.

665
01:19:48,601 --> 01:19:51,186
Pictures of you, John,
your big friend here.

666
01:19:51,225 --> 01:19:54,072
Cops are going nuts
looking for you.

667
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,721
I just came for my stuff.
I need clothes, food and a truck.

668
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,648
How about the fiillings in my teeth?

669
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,785
Now, Enrique.

670
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:08,179
You two,
you're on weapons detail.

671
01:20:08,217 --> 01:20:09,493
Let's go.

672
01:20:29,592 --> 01:20:31,480
One thing about my mom-

673
01:20:33,656 --> 01:20:35,543
she always plans ahead.

674
01:20:45,973 --> 01:20:46,288
Excellent.

675
01:20:57,138 --> 01:21:00,684
This is my best truck,
but the starter motor's gone.

676
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,610
You got time to change it out?

677
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:05,904
Yeah. I'm gonna wait 'til dark
to cross the border.

678
01:21:05,938 --> 01:21:07,400
Enrique.

679
01:21:07,442 --> 01:21:10,890
It's dangerous for you here.
You get out tonight too, okay?

680
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:13,418
Sure.

681
01:21:13,458 --> 01:21:17,036
Just drop by anytime
and totally fuck up my life, all right?

682
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:24,681
See, I grew up in places like this...

683
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:27,089
so I just thought
that's how people lived-

684
01:21:28,306 --> 01:21:30,956
riding around in helicopters...

685
01:21:31,954 --> 01:21:34,125
learning how to blow shit up.

686
01:21:35,538 --> 01:21:38,123
But then when my mom got busted...

687
01:21:38,162 --> 01:21:40,463
I got put into a regular school.

688
01:21:41,073 --> 01:21:43,757
All the other kids
were into Nintendo.

689
01:21:57,393 --> 01:21:59,498
Are you ever afraid?

690
01:21:59,537 --> 01:22:01,642
No.

691
01:22:04,497 --> 01:22:06,123
Not even of dying?

692
01:22:06,737 --> 01:22:08,525
No.

693
01:22:12,753 --> 01:22:16,876
You don't feel any emotion about it,
one way or another?

694
01:22:16,913 --> 01:22:20,742
No. I have to stay functional
until my mission is complete.

695
01:22:25,521 --> 01:22:28,554
Then it doesn't matter.

696
01:22:28,593 --> 01:22:32,073
I have to stay functional too.
"I'm too important."

697
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,451
That's defiinitely you.

698
01:23:00,304 --> 01:23:02,671
Most of the guys my mom
hung around with were geeks...

699
01:23:03,248 --> 01:23:06,660
but there was this one guy,
he was kinda cool.

700
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,587
He taught me engines.

701
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:10,758
Hold here.

702
01:23:10,796 --> 01:23:13,130
Mom screwed it up, of course.

703
01:23:13,163 --> 01:23:15,552
She'd always tell 'em
about Judgment Day...

704
01:23:15,595 --> 01:23:18,312
and me being this world leader.

705
01:23:18,348 --> 01:23:20,235
That'd be all she wrote.

706
01:23:21,515 --> 01:23:22,595
Torque wrench, please.

707
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:25,958
Here.

708
01:23:25,995 --> 01:23:29,094
I wish I could've met
my real dad.

709
01:23:29,131 --> 01:23:30,854
You will.

710
01:23:30,892 --> 01:23:33,030
Yeah, I guess.

711
01:23:33,067 --> 01:23:36,776
When I'm, like, 45, I think.

712
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:40,423
They sent him back through time
to 1984.

713
01:23:40,459 --> 01:23:41,866
Man.

714
01:23:43,307 --> 01:23:45,674
He hasn't even been born yet.

715
01:23:47,371 --> 01:23:49,258
It messes with your head.

716
01:23:51,851 --> 01:23:54,699
- The other bolt.
- Oh. Here.

717
01:24:00,747 --> 01:24:04,195
Mom and him were only together
for one night.

718
01:24:04,235 --> 01:24:06,624
She still loves him, I guess.

719
01:24:06,666 --> 01:24:09,481
I see her crying sometimes.

720
01:24:09,515 --> 01:24:13,792
She denies it totally, of course,
like she got something stuck in her eye.

721
01:24:18,090 --> 01:24:19,584
Why do you cry?

722
01:24:20,618 --> 01:24:22,080
- You mean people?
- Yeah.

723
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:23,497
I don't know.

724
01:24:23,531 --> 01:24:25,571
We just cry...

725
01:24:25,611 --> 01:24:28,099
you know, when it hurts.

726
01:24:33,899 --> 01:24:35,622
Pain causes it?

727
01:24:36,618 --> 01:24:38,691
No. It's different.

728
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:41,927
It's when there's nothing wrong
with you, but you hurt anyway.

729
01:24:41,962 --> 01:24:43,522
- You get it?
- No.

730
01:24:44,714 --> 01:24:46,404
All right, my man!

731
01:24:46,954 --> 01:24:47,936
No problemo.

732
01:24:48,106 --> 01:24:49,666
Give me fiive.

733
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:53,666
Just put out your hand
like this.

734
01:24:54,954 --> 01:24:59,110
All right! Now hit me.
Give me fiive. Do the same thing.

735
01:25:03,625 --> 01:25:06,014
Okay, that's good.
Up high.

736
01:25:06,922 --> 01:25:08,198
Five low.

737
01:25:08,906 --> 01:25:09,888
Too slow.

738
01:25:12,713 --> 01:25:14,917
I'm just kidding.
One more time.

739
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:17,125
Good. Now try it.

740
01:25:17,161 --> 01:25:19,049
Now do me.
Give me fiive.

741
01:25:20,426 --> 01:25:24,833
Watching John with the machine,
it was suddenly so clear.

742
01:25:24,874 --> 01:25:27,721
The Terminator would never stop.

743
01:25:27,754 --> 01:25:31,583
It would never leave him,
never hurt him...

744
01:25:31,625 --> 01:25:34,941
never shout at him
or get drunk and hit him...

745
01:25:34,985 --> 01:25:37,472
or be too busy
to spend time with him.

746
01:25:38,281 --> 01:25:40,353
It would always be there...

747
01:25:40,393 --> 01:25:42,978
and it would die
to protect him.

748
01:25:44,297 --> 01:25:47,558
Of all the would-be fathers
who came and went over the years...

749
01:25:47,593 --> 01:25:49,567
this thing, this machine...

750
01:25:49,609 --> 01:25:51,910
was the only one
who measured up.

751
01:25:52,617 --> 01:25:54,439
In an insane world...

752
01:25:54,473 --> 01:25:56,360
it was the sanest choice.

753
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:32,006
Hey, let's try this one.

754
01:27:37,383 --> 01:27:39,521
There we go.

755
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:23,642
She said go south with him
like you planned.

756
01:29:23,685 --> 01:29:25,823
- She'll meet you tomorrow.
- Mom!

757
01:29:27,525 --> 01:29:28,670
Mom, wait!

758
01:29:43,301 --> 01:29:44,707
"No fate."

759
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:48,227
No fate but what we make.

760
01:29:50,244 --> 01:29:52,131
My father told her this.

761
01:29:54,628 --> 01:29:58,752
I made him memorize it in the future
as a message to her.

762
01:30:00,324 --> 01:30:02,211
Never mind.

763
01:30:02,244 --> 01:30:05,506
Okay, the whole thing goes-

764
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,158
The future's not set.

765
01:30:08,196 --> 01:30:11,611
There's no fate but what
we make for ourselves.

766
01:30:11,652 --> 01:30:14,587
She intends to change the future.

767
01:30:14,628 --> 01:30:16,035
Yeah, I guess.

768
01:30:17,508 --> 01:30:19,296
Oh, shit!

769
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:21,219
- Dyson.
- Yeah.

770
01:30:21,252 --> 01:30:24,634
Gotta be. Miles Dyson.

771
01:30:24,676 --> 01:30:26,650
She's gonna blow him away.

772
01:30:26,691 --> 01:30:28,666
Come on! Let's go!

773
01:30:40,579 --> 01:30:42,554
This is tactically dangerous.

774
01:30:42,595 --> 01:30:43,675
Drive faster.

775
01:30:43,715 --> 01:30:46,203
The T-1000 has the same fiiles
that I do.

776
01:30:46,243 --> 01:30:49,559
It knows what I know.
It might anticipate this move.

777
01:30:49,604 --> 01:30:51,992
I don't care.
We gotta stop her.

778
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,922
Killing Dyson
might prevent the war.

779
01:30:53,955 --> 01:30:55,743
I don't care!

780
01:30:56,321 --> 01:30:58,044
Haven't you learned anything yet?

781
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,502
Haven't you fiigured out
why you can't kill people?

782
01:31:03,072 --> 01:31:05,560
Look, maybe you don't care
if you live or die...

783
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,705
but everybody's not like that.

784
01:31:07,744 --> 01:31:11,192
We have feelings.
We hurt. We're afraid.

785
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:17,146
You got to learn this stuff.
I'm not kidding. It's important.

786
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,316
Danny, I told you to go to bed,
like your sister.

787
01:31:56,351 --> 01:31:58,555
Just a couple of minutes, Mom!

788
01:32:14,527 --> 01:32:16,829
Danny, your time is up!

789
01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:19,710
Come brush your teeth
and get to bed.

790
01:32:47,068 --> 01:32:48,629
Danny!

791
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,082
Daddy!

792
01:33:01,115 --> 01:33:03,504
Danny, go! Go!

793
01:33:04,988 --> 01:33:06,165
Miles?

794
01:33:11,164 --> 01:33:13,531
- Tortsia, run!
- Oh, my God!

795
01:33:20,283 --> 01:33:22,258
Just take Danny and run!

796
01:33:22,299 --> 01:33:23,543
Run!

797
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:25,303
Oh, Jesus! Miles!

798
01:33:43,387 --> 01:33:44,402
Daddy!

799
01:33:45,979 --> 01:33:47,441
Nobody fucking move!

800
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:49,431
Don't hurt my daddy!

801
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:50,994
On the floor, bitch.

802
01:33:51,034 --> 01:33:53,139
Get down now!

803
01:33:53,947 --> 01:33:55,027
Get out of the way!

804
01:33:55,067 --> 01:33:56,474
Don't hurt him!

805
01:33:57,883 --> 01:33:59,857
Get on the floor now!

806
01:34:02,747 --> 01:34:04,438
Just let the boy go.

807
01:34:04,474 --> 01:34:06,034
Shut up. Shut up.

808
01:34:06,075 --> 01:34:07,351
Shut up!

809
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:09,907
It's all your fault, motherfucker.

810
01:34:09,946 --> 01:34:12,150
- It's all your fault!
- What?

811
01:34:12,187 --> 01:34:14,226
I'm not gonna let you do it.

812
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:06,162
Shit! We're too late!

813
01:35:10,425 --> 01:35:11,505
Check them.

814
01:35:15,033 --> 01:35:16,975
Look at me, Mom.

815
01:35:17,017 --> 01:35:19,156
Are you hurt?

816
01:35:22,617 --> 01:35:24,624
I almost-

817
01:35:35,769 --> 01:35:38,071
It'll be okay.

818
01:35:38,104 --> 01:35:39,992
We'll fiigure something out.
Okay?

819
01:35:41,496 --> 01:35:43,122
I promise.

820
01:35:46,232 --> 01:35:49,079
You came here to stop me.

821
01:35:49,913 --> 01:35:51,800
Yeah, I did.

822
01:35:54,553 --> 01:35:56,462
I love you, John.

823
01:35:58,072 --> 01:35:59,599
I always have.

824
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:02,807
I know.

825
01:36:09,496 --> 01:36:11,635
Deep penetration.

826
01:36:13,144 --> 01:36:15,032
No shattered bone.

827
01:36:15,064 --> 01:36:17,912
Hold here.
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

828
01:36:28,216 --> 01:36:29,590
Who are you people?

829
01:36:30,488 --> 01:36:31,895
Show him.

830
01:36:34,424 --> 01:36:38,483
Danny, I want you to come with me
right now. Show me your room.

831
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:18,482
Oh, my God.

832
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:21,072
Now listen to me
very carefully.

833
01:37:26,711 --> 01:37:30,704
Dyson listened while the Terminator
laid it all down.

834
01:37:30,743 --> 01:37:34,485
Skynet. Judgment Day.

835
01:37:34,518 --> 01:37:36,755
The history of things to come.

836
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:40,785
It's not every day that
you find out you're responsible...

837
01:37:40,823 --> 01:37:43,572
for three billion deaths.

838
01:37:43,606 --> 01:37:45,493
He took it pretty well.

839
01:37:47,383 --> 01:37:49,749
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

840
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:57,583
You're judging me...

841
01:37:57,622 --> 01:37:59,989
on things I haven't even done yet.

842
01:38:04,022 --> 01:38:06,061
How were we supposed to know?

843
01:38:08,406 --> 01:38:10,316
Yeah.

844
01:38:10,358 --> 01:38:12,692
Right.

845
01:38:12,726 --> 01:38:14,798
How were you supposed to know?

846
01:38:15,797 --> 01:38:17,586
Fucking men like you...

847
01:38:17,622 --> 01:38:19,378
built the hydrogen bomb.

848
01:38:19,414 --> 01:38:21,934
Men like you...

849
01:38:21,974 --> 01:38:23,380
thought it up.

850
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:28,949
You think you're so creative.

851
01:38:30,293 --> 01:38:33,293
You don't know what it's like
to really create something...

852
01:38:33,333 --> 01:38:35,438
to create a life...

853
01:38:35,478 --> 01:38:36,972
to feel it growing inside you.

854
01:38:37,013 --> 01:38:39,860
All you know how to create
is death and destruction.

855
01:38:39,893 --> 01:38:41,551
Mom!

856
01:38:41,589 --> 01:38:45,234
We need to be a little more
constructive here. Okay?

857
01:38:45,269 --> 01:38:47,309
We still have to stop this
from happening.

858
01:38:47,349 --> 01:38:50,099
But I thought-

859
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:53,995
Aren't we changing things right now,
changing the way it goes?

860
01:38:54,037 --> 01:38:58,706
That's right. There's no way I'm going
to fiinish the new processor. Not now.

861
01:38:58,741 --> 01:39:02,089
Forget it. I'm out of it.
I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.

862
01:39:02,133 --> 01:39:03,987
That's not good enough.

863
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,908
No one must follow your work.

864
01:39:05,941 --> 01:39:07,763
Right.

865
01:39:07,797 --> 01:39:12,019
All right, then we have to destroy
all the stuff at the lab-

866
01:39:12,053 --> 01:39:13,613
the fiiles, the disk drives...

867
01:39:13,652 --> 01:39:16,238
everything here.

868
01:39:16,276 --> 01:39:18,284
Everything.

869
01:39:18,325 --> 01:39:20,212
I don't care.

870
01:39:21,397 --> 01:39:22,411
The chip.

871
01:39:22,452 --> 01:39:24,492
- Do you know about the chip?
- What chip?

872
01:39:24,533 --> 01:39:26,899
It's at Cyberdyne.
It's from the other one like you.

873
01:39:26,932 --> 01:39:29,583
The CPU from the fiirst Terminator.

874
01:39:29,620 --> 01:39:31,954
Son of a bitch!
I knew it!

875
01:39:31,988 --> 01:39:34,639
They told us not to ask
where they got it.

876
01:39:34,676 --> 01:39:36,945
Those lying motherfuckers.

877
01:39:36,981 --> 01:39:38,737
It's scary stuff.
Radically advanced.

878
01:39:38,772 --> 01:39:39,917
It was smashed.

879
01:39:39,957 --> 01:39:43,469
It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
took us in new directions.

880
01:39:43,508 --> 01:39:45,450
Things we would've never-

881
01:39:47,508 --> 01:39:49,548
All my work was based on it.

882
01:39:49,588 --> 01:39:51,344
It must be destroyed.

883
01:39:53,492 --> 01:39:56,427
Can you get us in?
Past security?

884
01:39:56,468 --> 01:39:58,475
I think so, yeah. When?

885
01:40:03,155 --> 01:40:04,235
Now?

886
01:40:07,892 --> 01:40:10,859
The future,
always so clear to me...

887
01:40:10,899 --> 01:40:13,801
had become like
a black highway at night.

888
01:40:13,844 --> 01:40:16,494
We were in
uncharted territory now...

889
01:40:16,532 --> 01:40:19,379
making up history
as we went along.

890
01:40:56,083 --> 01:40:57,970
Carl, right?

891
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:02,535
Friends from out of town.
I just thought I'd...

892
01:41:02,578 --> 01:41:04,553
take 'em upstairs
and show 'em around.

893
01:41:04,594 --> 01:41:07,791
Mr. Dyson, you know the rules
concerning visitors in the lab.

894
01:41:07,826 --> 01:41:09,898
I need written authorization-

895
01:41:10,899 --> 01:41:12,873
I insist.

896
01:41:12,915 --> 01:41:14,638
Don't even think about it.

897
01:41:25,106 --> 01:41:26,513
It's okay.

898
01:41:27,858 --> 01:41:30,891
It takes two keys, turned
simultaneously, to open the vault.

899
01:41:30,930 --> 01:41:33,777
The other one is in a locker
at the security station.

900
01:41:35,026 --> 01:41:36,433
Gibbons?

901
01:41:39,346 --> 01:41:41,135
Gibbons! Come on, man!

902
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:44,170
You can't leave the desk
like that!

903
01:41:48,786 --> 01:41:50,215
Oh, shit.

904
01:42:07,057 --> 01:42:09,032
My card should access this.

905
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,825
- What is it?
- Damn it.

906
01:42:15,857 --> 01:42:17,767
The silent alarm's been tripped.

907
01:42:23,665 --> 01:42:26,315
It's neutralized all the codes
in the entire building.

908
01:42:26,353 --> 01:42:28,240
Nothing will open anywhere now.

909
01:42:29,233 --> 01:42:31,055
We have to abort.

910
01:42:34,097 --> 01:42:37,392
We go all the way.
Okay?

911
01:42:39,409 --> 01:42:43,118
You guys get started on the lab.
I can open this.

912
01:42:43,153 --> 01:42:45,520
- I think it's that guy from the mall.
- It is.

913
01:42:45,552 --> 01:42:47,440
It's him and the woman.

914
01:42:48,913 --> 01:42:52,011
Just send everything
you got in the area right now.

915
01:42:54,096 --> 01:42:57,413
I have a personal entry code
for the lab. It may still work.

916
01:43:01,712 --> 01:43:02,792
It's no good.

917
01:43:02,832 --> 01:43:04,294
Let me try mine.

918
01:43:09,072 --> 01:43:11,112
John, fiire in the hole!

919
01:43:22,608 --> 01:43:27,278
Wait! You can't go in there.
The fiire set off the Halon system.

920
01:43:34,096 --> 01:43:36,013
You have to wait
until the gas clears.

921
01:43:38,859 --> 01:43:40,103
Put this on.

922
01:43:53,482 --> 01:43:55,937
All right, let's get to work.

923
01:44:16,201 --> 01:44:19,398
All units in the vicinity
and all units able to respond...

924
01:44:19,433 --> 01:44:24,102
a 211 in progress, 2144 Kramer Street,
the Cyberdyne building.

925
01:44:24,137 --> 01:44:25,763
Suspect one is white female...

926
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:29,150
identified as last name Connor,
first name Sarah.

927
01:44:29,193 --> 01:44:32,040
Escaped last night
from Pescadero State Hospital.

928
01:44:32,073 --> 01:44:33,960
Suspect two.: White male...

929
01:44:37,449 --> 01:44:39,554
All the disks in my offiice...

930
01:44:39,593 --> 01:44:41,698
all the disks
in that offiice over there...

931
01:44:41,737 --> 01:44:43,679
everything behind my desk...

932
01:44:43,721 --> 01:44:45,925
and all the processors
on my left.

933
01:44:45,961 --> 01:44:48,448
We'll blow those with the CP 4.

934
01:45:01,480 --> 01:45:02,909
Can I...

935
01:45:03,529 --> 01:45:05,252
Excuse me.

936
01:45:06,857 --> 01:45:09,377
Can I borrow that thing?

937
01:45:18,089 --> 01:45:20,358
I worked a lot of years on this thing.

938
01:45:24,201 --> 01:45:26,339
One-Mary-23,
give me that location again.

939
01:45:26,377 --> 01:45:28,100
2111 Kramer.

940
01:45:28,136 --> 01:45:31,006
Suspects are armed and
considered extremely dangerous.

941
01:46:21,218 --> 01:46:22,876
All right.

942
01:46:22,915 --> 01:46:24,638
7-2-5-6.

943
01:46:31,330 --> 01:46:32,639
Easy money.

944
01:46:37,186 --> 01:46:38,593
Uh-oh.

945
01:46:41,186 --> 01:46:43,553
Oh, shit. Not good.

946
01:46:48,386 --> 01:46:49,978
How we doing?

947
01:46:50,018 --> 01:46:51,676
Primer cord is set.

948
01:46:51,714 --> 01:46:54,081
One more barrel,
two more minutes.

949
01:46:57,794 --> 01:47:00,641
- How do we set them off?
- Remote control.

950
01:47:00,673 --> 01:47:03,008
Piece of cake.

951
01:47:03,041 --> 01:47:04,535
- We got company.
- Police?

952
01:47:04,578 --> 01:47:07,839
- How many?
- All of'em, I think.

953
01:47:07,874 --> 01:47:09,216
Go. I'll fiinish here.

954
01:47:11,106 --> 01:47:12,513
Come on.

955
01:47:13,505 --> 01:47:15,393
I'll take care of the police.

956
01:47:15,425 --> 01:47:16,702
Wait! You swore!

957
01:47:19,521 --> 01:47:20,928
Trust me.

958
01:47:33,633 --> 01:47:35,226
You at the window!

959
01:47:35,265 --> 01:47:38,614
Drop your weapon and place
your hands on top of your head!

960
01:47:39,873 --> 01:47:41,661
Holy shit!

961
01:47:41,697 --> 01:47:43,191
That's a mini-gun!

962
01:48:04,513 --> 01:48:06,782
- Come on!
- Oh, shit!

963
01:48:06,816 --> 01:48:08,343
Go! Go! Go!

964
01:48:53,951 --> 01:48:55,358
Fire!

965
01:49:11,968 --> 01:49:13,593
Same time, to the left.

966
01:49:13,631 --> 01:49:15,901
One, two, three, go.

967
01:49:27,519 --> 01:49:30,269
In order to get that out-

968
01:49:36,735 --> 01:49:39,419
We got Skynet by the balls now.

969
01:49:39,455 --> 01:49:40,631
Come on, let's book.

970
01:49:42,206 --> 01:49:43,700
Hold your fiire!

971
01:50:08,062 --> 01:50:10,036
- Ready to rock?
- Ready.

972
01:50:13,501 --> 01:50:14,778
Time to go.

973
01:50:14,813 --> 01:50:16,242
Now.

974
01:50:16,285 --> 01:50:19,155
- Take this. They'll use gas.
- Come on.

975
01:50:19,197 --> 01:50:22,197
Get started on the door.
Miles, hand me the detonator.

976
01:50:45,437 --> 01:50:48,120
Mom! Mom!

977
01:51:30,652 --> 01:51:31,732
Shit!

978
01:51:33,084 --> 01:51:35,931
She's in the clean room.
There's no way outta there.

979
01:51:45,052 --> 01:51:46,034
Get down!

980
01:51:53,148 --> 01:51:54,555
Here.

981
01:52:19,003 --> 01:52:22,319
I don't know how much longer
I can hold this.

982
01:52:26,299 --> 01:52:27,761
Fall back!

983
01:52:27,803 --> 01:52:29,363
Everybody out!

984
01:52:29,403 --> 01:52:31,257
Fall back now!
Go! Go! Go!

985
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:07,097
We got a war zone here!

986
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,348
Shut your eyes.

987
01:53:45,657 --> 01:53:48,723
Stay here. I'll be back.

988
01:53:56,184 --> 01:53:58,454
Get down on the floor!
Face down!

989
01:54:01,049 --> 01:54:02,543
On the floor now!

990
01:54:04,793 --> 01:54:06,254
Okay, drop him!

991
01:55:22,839 --> 01:55:24,246
Here, hold this.

992
01:55:40,311 --> 01:55:41,872
Holy shit!

993
01:55:56,311 --> 01:55:57,293
Go!

994
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:35,532
Shit!

995
01:56:48,470 --> 01:56:50,096
Get out.

996
01:57:08,341 --> 01:57:09,650
Listen.

997
01:57:09,686 --> 01:57:12,304
No matter what happens,
stay under these vests.

998
01:57:12,341 --> 01:57:13,618
- You got it?
- Yeah.

999
01:57:13,653 --> 01:57:15,060
All right.

1000
01:57:28,981 --> 01:57:30,225
Chopper's coming in!

1001
01:57:30,260 --> 01:57:31,340
It's him.

1002
01:58:26,740 --> 01:58:28,082
Shit!

1003
01:58:30,804 --> 01:58:32,560
Stay down!

1004
01:59:43,762 --> 01:59:45,486
Goddamn!

1005
01:59:45,522 --> 01:59:46,504
You okay-

1006
01:59:53,298 --> 01:59:55,665
Come on, Mom,
we gotta get out.

1007
01:59:57,458 --> 01:59:59,051
Take the shotgun.

1008
02:00:02,674 --> 02:00:03,656
Are you hurt?

1009
02:00:16,306 --> 02:00:17,288
Holy shit.

1010
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:19,152
Come on, Mom. Come on!

1011
02:00:19,186 --> 02:00:20,298
We need your truck.

1012
02:00:20,337 --> 02:00:21,799
Hurry!

1013
02:00:26,578 --> 02:00:29,033
- Come on. Hurry.
- Get in.

1014
02:00:31,857 --> 02:00:33,067
Go!

1015
02:00:38,801 --> 02:00:40,743
What the hell-

1016
02:00:46,353 --> 02:00:49,036
- I'm bleeding bad.
- Keep pressure on it.

1017
02:00:50,609 --> 02:00:52,202
Here. This'll work.

1018
02:00:57,553 --> 02:00:59,179
He's gaining.

1019
02:01:01,617 --> 02:01:03,275
Step on it!

1020
02:01:03,313 --> 02:01:06,030
- This is the vehicle's top speed.
- I can run faster than this!

1021
02:01:16,401 --> 02:01:17,808
Coming up, to the right.

1022
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:21,648
Watch it! Watch it!

1023
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,320
- Drive.
- Where are you going?

1024
02:01:52,464 --> 02:01:54,351
Take the off-ramp.

1025
02:02:03,600 --> 02:02:04,745
Shit!

1026
02:02:07,759 --> 02:02:08,774
Hold on!

1027
02:02:52,751 --> 02:02:54,344
Don't stop!

1028
02:03:01,839 --> 02:03:03,180
Go straight!

1029
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:06,692
Look out!

1030
02:03:06,735 --> 02:03:07,717
Duck!

1031
02:03:21,455 --> 02:03:23,342
Get the hell outta here!

1032
02:03:28,622 --> 02:03:31,590
Get outta here!
Let's go! Come on!

1033
02:04:45,388 --> 02:04:47,777
Hasta la vista, baby.

1034
02:05:35,244 --> 02:05:36,651
We don't have much time.

1035
02:05:58,347 --> 02:05:59,591
Let's go.

1036
02:06:00,587 --> 02:06:02,278
We gotta get outta here.

1037
02:06:02,315 --> 02:06:04,355
Come on! Get up!

1038
02:06:17,355 --> 02:06:19,045
Hand me the shotgun.

1039
02:06:23,627 --> 02:06:25,831
Put your weight on me, Mom.

1040
02:06:26,603 --> 02:06:28,457
Hurry!

1041
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:33,443
Come on, Mom.

1042
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:40,935
Get up!

1043
02:07:11,110 --> 02:07:12,997
This way. Come on.

1044
02:07:40,672 --> 02:07:43,257
Wait! No. No. It's too hot.

1045
02:07:43,296 --> 02:07:44,539
Go back.

1046
02:07:52,383 --> 02:07:54,587
- Go. Run.
- No! We gotta stick together.

1047
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:56,566
John, you've got to go now.

1048
02:07:56,608 --> 02:07:58,713
- John!
- Go! Now!

1049
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:11,837
Get up the steps.

1050
02:09:13,694 --> 02:09:15,101
Go.

1051
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:20,317
Get up.

1052
02:09:21,086 --> 02:09:23,126
Come on, Mom.
I got you.

1053
02:09:56,158 --> 02:09:58,427
Grab the chain. Grab it.

1054
02:09:59,742 --> 02:10:02,327
Grab it. Go. Go!

1055
02:10:12,253 --> 02:10:15,417
Mom, come on! Mom!

1056
02:11:02,557 --> 02:11:04,313
Call to John.

1057
02:11:06,972 --> 02:11:08,760
I know this hurts.

1058
02:11:10,492 --> 02:11:12,085
CalIJohn.

1059
02:11:27,804 --> 02:11:30,357
Call to John now.

1060
02:11:32,348 --> 02:11:34,136
Fuck you.

1061
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:44,983
Help!

1062
02:15:04,661 --> 02:15:05,708
Mom.

1063
02:15:07,827 --> 02:15:09,714
Help me.

1064
02:15:12,211 --> 02:15:13,455
Get out of the way, John.

1065
02:15:16,659 --> 02:15:17,161
Shoot!

1066
02:16:10,158 --> 02:16:12,525
Get down!

1067
02:17:41,965 --> 02:17:44,070
Get up. Come on.

1068
02:17:46,221 --> 02:17:47,977
Holy shit.

1069
02:17:48,013 --> 02:17:50,380
I need a vacation.

1070
02:18:03,053 --> 02:18:05,769
Is it dead?

1071
02:18:05,805 --> 02:18:07,212
Terminated.

1072
02:18:10,445 --> 02:18:12,134
Will this melt in there?

1073
02:18:14,956 --> 02:18:16,778
Yes. Throw it in.

1074
02:18:21,261 --> 02:18:22,243
Adios.

1075
02:18:23,564 --> 02:18:25,451
And the chip.

1076
02:18:39,980 --> 02:18:41,540
It's over.

1077
02:18:48,076 --> 02:18:49,701
There's one more chip.

1078
02:18:54,156 --> 02:18:56,360
And it must be destroyed also.

1079
02:19:01,547 --> 02:19:03,107
Here.

1080
02:19:03,148 --> 02:19:06,443
I cannot self-terminate.
You must lower me into the steel.

1081
02:19:19,020 --> 02:19:21,409
I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.

1082
02:19:21,451 --> 02:19:23,687
No, it'll be okay.
Stay with us.

1083
02:19:23,723 --> 02:19:25,697
- It'll be okay.
- I have to go away.

1084
02:19:25,739 --> 02:19:28,260
No, don't do it.
Please, don't go.

1085
02:19:28,299 --> 02:19:31,266
I must go away, John.

1086
02:19:31,307 --> 02:19:32,768
No, wait.

1087
02:19:32,811 --> 02:19:34,273
You don't have to do this.

1088
02:19:34,315 --> 02:19:35,624
I'm sorry.

1089
02:19:36,491 --> 02:19:38,695
No, don't do it! Don't go!

1090
02:19:38,730 --> 02:19:40,618
It has to end here.

1091
02:19:41,770 --> 02:19:44,934
I order you not to go!

1092
02:19:52,555 --> 02:19:54,529
I know now why you cry.

1093
02:19:56,811 --> 02:19:59,200
But it's something
I can never do.

1094
02:20:32,074 --> 02:20:34,213
Good-bye.

1095
02:22:09,188 --> 02:22:12,155
The unknown future
rolls toward us.

1096
02:22:12,196 --> 02:22:15,993
I face it for the first time
with a sense of hope.

1097
02:22:16,036 --> 02:22:18,338
Because if a machine,
a Terminator...

1098
02:22:18,372 --> 02:22:21,667
can learn the value
of human life...

1099
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:24,067
maybe we can too.

1100
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:28,092
