1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,100
Far in the dim past. . .

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,100
when myth and history
merged into mystery

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,400
and the gods of fable
and the primitive beliefs of man

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,600
dwelt on ancient
Mount Olympus,

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,600
in antique Greece

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,000
a legendary hero walked
godlike upon the earth. . .

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,700
sometimes.

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500
Man: Why can't I go?

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
Because your place
is here with the rest of us.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,300
- You let Mars travel.
- That's his job.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,800
Until mankind learns to dispense
with his services

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,300
and lives in peace,
Mars must go where he's called.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,600
I only want
to browse around.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,100
You'd only get into trouble.

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,200
I have been here
thousands of years.

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,400
- I am bored.
- Don't interrupt your father!

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,300
Besides. . .

18
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,800
these mortals are
bedeviled by

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
as aggravating a collection
of annoyances

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,000
as it is possible for one
to imagine.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,900
It may not be entirely
without merit,

22
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,000
- but you wouldn't like it there.
- Let me be the judge of that.

23
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,300
I am tired of the same old faces,
the same old things.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,000
Tired or not,
you're staying here!

25
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,000
Woman: Zeus, I beg of you,

26
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,500
Hercules is only hotheaded.

27
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,300
He does not mean to oppose
your wishes.

28
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,200
Mind your own business,
Venus.

29
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
He has grown insufferable.

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,500
I will not be bearded to my face
by this insolent young whelp.

31
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
He's only a demigod.

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,300
He gives himself airs
his mortal birth does not warrant.

33
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,700
My mother may have been a mortal,
but you, Zeus, my father,

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,300
are a god.

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,500
I will discuss this
no further.

36
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Does this mean I have
Zeus' permission to leave?

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,500
It means you will stay.

38
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,900
I don't wish to hear
another word on the subject.

39
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,500
I won't stay.

40
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,800
You are trying my patience,
Hercules.

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,500
- You are trying mine.
- Heed my words!

42
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,700
Nobody will stop me.

43
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,200
How dare you address
such remarks to your father!

44
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,700
It's easy.

45
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Why you offensive puppy!

46
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,500
Perhaps this will teach you
respect for your elders!

47
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,300
Venus: Zeus,
Hercules is half mortal.

48
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,300
- He may be killed.
- He's only a spoiled youth.

49
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,400
Save him.

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Hercules is your son.
Forgive him!

51
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,400
If I had known how much trouble
it would cause me,

52
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,800
I'd have thought twice when I met
his mother on vacation.

53
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000
Aahh!

54
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,100
- Tell me what's wrong.
- I just saw a man.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Yes, my dear, that's not unusual.
There are men on this airplane.

56
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,600
No, outside!

57
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,400
- He was flying.
- Outside?

58
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,400
Yes, he just passed my window.

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,700
Stewardess!

60
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
And he was. . .
he was naked!

61
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,600
And he was just going down,
flying.

62
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,200
- And he. . .
- We're traveling at 30,000 feet.

63
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,300
No man,
nude or otherwise,

64
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
could possibly be flying
outside a jet plane.

65
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,700
Oh, he was very handsome.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
And he had big muscles.

67
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
And he was practically naked.

68
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,500
Oh, dear.
Oh, my.

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,900
I shouldn't have taken Agatha
to see all those Greek statues.

70
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
She's so impressionable.

71
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,400
We throw ourselves
at Zeus' feet.

72
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,000
Woman: Get up,
you stupid creatures.

73
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,800
Let Hercules suffer the consequences
of his own obstinacy.

74
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,900
J uno has hated Hercules
ever since the day of his birth.

75
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,400
All right! Do not be
disrespectful to my wife.

76
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
Let us see what
he is doing now.

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,600
( claps hands )

78
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,100
He's in the sea now.
He will drown!

79
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
Save him, Great Zeus.

80
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,000
It will take more than Neptune
or any of his creatures

81
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,700
- to overcome a son of Zeus.
- Save him, Zeus!

82
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,100
Save Hercules!

83
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,900
All right, all right.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,800
I have done so.

85
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,400
Behold, coming over
the horizon of the sea.

86
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,000
( ship's horn blows )

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,000
What were you doing
out in the water?

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,800
- Swimming.
- A hundred miles from land?

89
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,700
I fell.

90
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,500
- Fell?
- Yes.

91
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
How did that happen?

92
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,700
- There was an explosion.
- Oh?

93
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,400
- What ship?
- Ship?

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,000
From which you
were blown overboard.

95
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,400
Olympus.

96
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,200
There's a Greek freighter
by that name.

97
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,800
- Greek, huh?
- Very old family.

99
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Sir?

100
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,500
It's all right,
I'm democratic.

101
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,400
You're addressing the captain
of this ship. Say ''sir'' to me.

102
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,400
- I am Hercules.
- So you told me.

103
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,200
No man is superior
to Hercules.

104
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,900
Begging the captain's
pardon,

105
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,700
but an immersion in the water
can put a man off his head.

106
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,200
H uh.

107
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,700
- What's your berth?
- I am the son of Zeus.

108
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,300
I'm referring to your rating,
not your family tree.

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,700
What's your rating
when you ship out to sea?

110
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,800
What's your second name?
Hercules what?

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,200
As I have told you,
I am Hercules, son of Zeus.

112
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,700
I don't think he means
any disrespect.

113
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,700
He probably loses it
in the translation.

114
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,600
All right, sign him on
as Hercules Zeus,

115
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,500
since that's his father name,
and get him an O.S. rating.

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,900
Aye, aye, sir.

117
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Get him what clothes
you can that might fit him.

118
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,500
Come with me.

119
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,400
- Where's this ship bound for?
- New York.

120
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Carstairs!

121
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
Carstairs!

122
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Stop that fight!

123
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,600
Okay, I'm with you, boy.
Better forget it.

124
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,100
Oh no, you don't. No, no.
I'm your friend.

125
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,900
Bosun,
what's the meaning of this?

126
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,700
Well, he refused to work, sir.

127
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,200
And when I tried
to persuade him, well, he. . .

128
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,800
He's a foreigner.

129
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Perhaps he didn't
understand you.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,600
I understood him.

131
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,900
He's most disagreeable
and he has irritated me.

132
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,400
- Where do you think you're going?
- Ashore.

133
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,700
- The captain give you permission?
- Hercules goes where he wishes.

134
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,000
Not on this ship, you don't.
Get your carcass below.

135
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,400
Get yours!

136
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,000
Yo, Hercules!
Come back here!

137
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,900
Stop him!
Somebody grab him!

138
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,300
Get him!

139
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,500
Alex!

140
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,500
Hey, you guys!

141
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,300
20 bucks for the first man
that flattens him.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,700
Man: Come on! Come on!

143
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Oooh!

144
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
Come on, push him.
That's it.

145
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,500
Come on!

146
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
Come on, push it!

147
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,000
Come on, let's get him!

148
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,900
You'd better get out of here.
They're gonna kill you!

149
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,500
Come on,
we'll get a cab.

150
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Here!

151
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Go ahead!

152
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,800
What's the matter with you?!
Let go!

153
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,000
Fine chariot,
but where are the horses?

154
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,700
Let go of that!
What's the matter?

155
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,700
Hey, let go of that!

156
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,800
Where to?

157
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,000
Uptown.
And step on it!

158
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,300
Boy, that was close.

159
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,300
What was close?

160
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,400
They almost nailed you!

161
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,200
What did you do?
J ump ship?

162
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,400
No, I walked off.

163
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
You walked off.

164
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,100
- What's your name?
- Hercules.

165
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,200
Oh. Mine is Pretzi.

166
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,500
They call me Pretzi,
because, you see,

167
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,900
I sell pretzels
on the waterfront.

168
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,800
- Where you from?
- Greece.

169
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
Oh! I used to know
a Greek guy.

170
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,900
He ran a beanery
down in the Village.

171
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,900
His name was Apollo.

172
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
I never found out
what his second name was.

173
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
- I know Apollo.
- You do?

174
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,900
Well, is this a small world?
You know Apollo. Gee.

175
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
I wonder where Apollo is now.

176
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,800
I haven't seen him
in two or three years.

177
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,000
- He's back home.
- He went home, huh?

178
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,500
He was all the time talking about
how homesick he was.

179
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
So he finally went home.

180
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,300
He was a real nice guy.

181
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Conceited. He thinks there's
nobody handsomer in the world.

182
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,900
Handsome? Apollo?

183
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,300
You must be kidding.
Come on, say you're kidding.

184
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,900
Handsome? With that big black
wart on his nose?

185
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,500
And those
little beady crossed eyes?

186
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
( laughing )

187
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,600
He must have been in disguise.

188
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,100
I wonder if Apollo
ever got married.

189
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,900
He was all the time
looking for a wife.

190
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe that's why he went home,
to find a wife.

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,200
Diana and Terpsichore
are in love with him.

192
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
I think Hebe is attracted, too.

193
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,200
No kidding.

194
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,900
It shows you how desperate
some women could be.

195
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
That is really amazing.

196
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You hungry?
Wait a minute.

197
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,600
Here, here.

198
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
Go ahead, help yourself.

199
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,000
- I'm grateful.
- Think nothing of it.

200
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
Good, huh?

201
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,400
Food for the gods.

202
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,200
Well, I get them
from a bakery in Brooklyn

203
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
called
''Food For the Gods Bakery.''

204
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,800
Where you guys wanna go?

205
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,200
Hey, what do you know?
Central Park.

206
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,900
This is good enough.

207
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,000
It's fine.

208
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,300
Here we are
in Central Park.

209
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,900
I'll go get my bag.

210
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,900
- That'll be two bucks.
- Big city, New York.

211
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
Bigger than Athens.

212
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,600
Bigger than Rome.

213
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,200
Bigger than Carthage.

214
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
I'd say New York is the biggest
place there is.

215
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,600
- Pay the cabbie.
- Pay him?

216
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,900
- What?
- For the ride, two bucks.

217
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,000
Bucks?

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,400
The bread, the shekels,

219
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,900
you know, the long green,
the money, two bucks!

220
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,000
He wants to be paid for driving
Hercules in the chariot?

221
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,600
That's the idea, mack.

222
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,400
My name is Hercules.

223
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,000
Hercules, Schmurcules,
give me the dough.

224
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,400
Bucks? Doe? What's all this talk
about male and female animals?

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,800
This guy got all his marbles?

226
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,100
He's just come over
from the old country.

227
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,600
Look, Herc, it's money.

228
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,500
You know, drachmas.

229
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,900
Money?

230
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,200
I don't have any money.

231
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,700
You don't have any money?

232
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,900
Holy moley.
He ain't got no money.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,600
Hercules doesn't need
any money.

234
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,100
What?

235
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,000
That's the stupidest thing
I've heard in my whole life.

236
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,100
A couple of deadbeats, huh?

237
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,100
Pretzi: Look, buddy,
you see. . .

238
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,000
There's been a little mistake.

239
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,100
Well, now,
ain't that something.

240
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,600
A mistake.

241
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Well, what do you know. . .

242
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,300
a mistake.

243
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,700
Last time, you gonna give up
the dough or ain't you?

244
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,700
Isn't it enough since Hercules
rode in your chariot?

245
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
You've been immortalized.

246
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
I've been who?

247
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,400
You heard him,
you've been immortalized.

248
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,900
- Driver: Are you nuts?
- Well, you see. . .

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,900
- It's like this--
- Driver: Like what?

250
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Well, you see. . .
uh, we, I--

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,900
Okay, call the cops.

252
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
Not before I have some fun
by taking it out of your hides.

253
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,900
- Run, Herc!
- You deadbeat!

254
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,400
How dare you
touch Hercules?!

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,900
Brad says we've got the best
all around team we've ever had,

256
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
a cinch to win first place
in the intercollegiate meet.

257
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,200
I should hope so.

258
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,800
I know Rod, for one,
has worked very hard,

259
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,600
even to the point
of neglecting you, I'm afraid.

260
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,500
I don't mind, Dad.
I want him to succeed.

261
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I'm sure he will,
darling.

262
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,000
You know what pleases me most,
Helen, about these boys?

263
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,500
J udging from their classroom work,
they apparently have brains

264
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,700
as well as brawn.

265
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,300
How are those men
over there?

266
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,300
They're just athletes
training.

267
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,200
- Athletes?
- College guys.

268
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,200
Hmmph. . .

269
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,600
What do you mean?
You think you could do better?

270
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,500
( snorts )

271
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,800
What do you mean?
These guys happen to be champions.

272
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
Ha!

273
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,200
- Nobody can beat them.
- Ha!

274
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,100
Wait!
Where are you going?

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,000
- Over there.
- What for?

276
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
To show them how
to throw the discus.

277
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,900
No, no.
You've gotta stay here.

278
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,700
You can't go
buttin' in there.

279
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
They would not like me
to instruct them?

280
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,400
No, it's just for college guys.
No outsiders allowed.

281
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,000
I am Hercules.

282
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,400
Put that discus down!
You have no business out here.

283
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,600
Those men do not throw it
far enough.

284
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
- You don't say.
- I do say.

285
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,300
- What is it, Helen?
- That man with the discus,

286
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,500
the coach seems to be
arguing with him.

287
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,400
These boys are
record holders.

288
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,600
Then they should
be better.

289
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,100
I suppose you believe
that you're better.

290
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,600
I once showed them in the
Olympics in Greece how to do it.

291
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,500
They profited by
my instruction.

292
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,200
You showed us in
the Greek Olympics, huh?

293
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
- What year was that?
- That was the year. . .

294
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Hey, coach.
Let him show us, coach.

295
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,200
Maybe there is something
we could learn.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
Well,
it's always possible.

297
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,100
All right, go ahead.
Show us.

298
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,000
Thank you.

299
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,500
What else do you do?

300
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
I ncredible.

301
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,600
Okay, Tom.

302
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,300
( cheers and applause )

303
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Great throw, Tom!
Great throw!

304
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,800
Okay, let's see you
beat that.

305
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,200
A very good throw
for the earthbound.

306
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,700
Skip the wisecracks.
Put your money where your mouth is.

307
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,400
I do not have any money.

308
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,700
I mean, stop talking. . .

309
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,300
demonstrate.

310
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,400
All right.

311
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,700
Wow.

312
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
That's my buddy.

313
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
He's a Greek fella.

314
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,300
He just come over. . .
from Greece.

315
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
- Dawson.
- Coach.

316
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,700
You're our anchorman here.

317
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,700
- Show this fella something.
- Yes, sir, coach.

318
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,900
Fifty bucks says my pal beats
that guy about to jump now.

319
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,100
I'll take that.
It's a bet.

320
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,600
- This fella can hold the money.
- No, that's all right.

321
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I trust ya, buddy.

322
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,500
All right, Mister.
Let's see you top that.

323
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,800
Certainly,
if you wish me to.

324
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Wish you?
Brother, I'm begging you.

325
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,500
- I beg your pardon?
- Why, what's the matter?

326
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,400
- Did I do something wrong?
- My name is Professor Camden.

327
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,500
- How do you do?
- And this is my daughter, Helen.

328
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,700
Here's our card.

329
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,300
I wonder if you'd
do me a favor.

330
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,800
Sure, spill it.

331
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
Have tea
with my daughter and me.

332
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,100
Shh! Not so loud!

333
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,500
You never know when one of them
narcotics cops is around.

334
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,700
Tea, the conventional
social drink.

335
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,400
You mean the drinking stuff?

336
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Of course! What else?

337
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,600
Wait a minute.

338
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,500
You want to get together
just to drink tea?

339
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,200
Do you find that
so uncommon?

340
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,100
Well, no, but eh. . .

341
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,000
it's just that nobody's ever invited
me to do that with them before.

342
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,700
Well, around 4:00, then.

343
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,100
Hm?

344
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,200
Great.

345
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,200
And bring your friend along.

346
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Hey, Herc!

347
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,100
( doorbell rings )

348
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
Please go into the library.

349
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll tell the professor
you're here.

350
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,500
Hercules: Ha, ha.
Pan.

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,400
It's a funny one.

352
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,400
I must tell him about this.

353
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,900
Yeah, you must do that.
Yeah.

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,400
Helen: Hello!

355
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,000
How do you do?
How do you do?

356
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm so happy you both
could be here.

357
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,100
Hey, cut that out!

358
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,000
- Won't you be seated?
- Thank you.

359
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,000
My father should be here
any minute.

360
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,700
- Is anything wrong?
- What could be wrong?

361
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,800
It's just that you're looking
at me so strangely

362
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,400
I feel my hair may be out of place
or something of the sort.

363
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,400
Everything's perfect.

364
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,200
Everything's in its place.

365
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,200
- You remind me of someone.
- Really? Someone you know?

366
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,300
- A goddess.
- A goddess?

367
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,400
I remind you of a goddess?

368
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,300
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

369
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,900
If the sun comes out,
it will be a beautiful day.

370
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,500
You and she do have
a lot in common.

371
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,300
It's kind of you to be
so complimentary, but. . .

372
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,800
I must say it's the first time
anyone's been quite so. . .

373
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,100
so extravagant with his comparisons
where I'm concerned.

374
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,000
( doorbell rings )

375
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,400
Excuse me,
that must be my other guest.

376
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,900
What's the matter with you?

377
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,800
Now you cut that out!
Talking that way to that dame.

378
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:57,700
You're acting like some kind
of a bull in a ten-cent store.

379
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,900
You just got here,
and right away you're on the make.

380
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,900
- What am I making?
- J ust cut it out.

381
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,800
That's no way to talk
to a dame.

382
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,700
I don't understand.

383
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,200
Maybe I'm being
a little rough on you.

384
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
Maybe you do things differently
where you come from,

385
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,100
but that's not the way we talk
to a dame here, that's all.

386
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,200
What did I say
that was wrong?

387
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
J ust cut it out!
That's all!

388
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,500
That's not the way to talk
to a broad, understand?

389
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,500
I guess you all
know each other.

390
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
- Hi, fellas.
- How do you do?

391
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
How are you doing?

392
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,000
- Hey, what's happening?
- Is he your lover?

393
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
My what?

394
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,500
Hey, Mister,
watch your talk!

395
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,600
I can hear my talk.
I cannot watch it.

396
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,800
You won't hear it much longer
if you don't apologize to her.

397
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,700
Apologize for paying
her a tribute?

398
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,000
A tribute?

399
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,600
- I nsulting her.
- A beautiful woman

400
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,500
with a handsome man for a friend,
they must be lovers.

401
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,700
Herc, you cool it!

402
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,100
I find it unnatural
if they're not.

403
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,700
All right,
you asked for it!

404
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
( thud )

405
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,800
Ughh!

406
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,900
You have struck Hercules.

407
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,200
Come off that rap. Keep that up,
and you'll have to be taken away.

408
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,100
What kind of chicken fat
you got in your head?

409
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,000
I am Hercules.

410
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,100
You're Hercules, I'm Rod Nelson.
Now what? Outside?

411
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,800
I can do it just as well
in here.

412
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,100
No, no.
You. . . you put him down!

413
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,700
- Helen: Really, you're crazy!
- Herc!

414
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,100
Will you put him down!

415
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,900
Please, Mr. Hercules.
Please put him down.

416
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,900
His first name is Hercules.

417
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,900
His last name is Zeus.
It rhymes with ''booze.''

418
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,300
I don't care what his name is.
Tell him to put Mr. Nelson down.

419
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,400
Herc, you heard
what the lady said.

420
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,500
Put the guy down.
What's the matter with you?

421
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,500
Pretzi: Put him down
on his feet!

422
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,400
Put him down!
Turn him loose!

423
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,100
Helen: Put him down!

424
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,800
- Put him down!
- Tea is served.

425
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,900
Well, I knew it.

426
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,700
Doesn't surprise me a bit.

427
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
Wherever he goes--
trouble.

428
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,200
What am I gonna do
with the young fool?

429
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,800
( sniffles )

430
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,300
Amusing situation with that fellow,
Hercules, wasn't it?

431
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,000
Amusing?
That man must be crazy!

432
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
- Original.
- Primitive.

433
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
- I find him refreshing.
- You must be kidding!

434
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,100
No.

435
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,400
He almost killed Rod Nelson.
He had to have some ribs taped.

436
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,000
Nevertheless,
Mr. Zeus interests me.

437
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,800
I'd like to get to know him better.
Study him more closely.

438
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,100
- Oh, really?
- Absolutely.

439
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,700
He had the effrontery to ask if
I'd have dinner with him tonight.

440
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,600
Well, of course you told him. . .

441
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,900
- I would.
- Naturally.

442
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,500
( animal growls and screeches )

443
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,100
( growling )

444
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,000
Oh, it was a
wonderful evening.

445
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:00,100
- Thank you so much
- I enjoyed it, too.

446
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,900
Are you homesick?

447
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,200
I'm having too much fun.

448
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,700
( hooves clipping )

449
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,500
( gorilla panting )

450
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,700
What's it like back there,
where you come from?

451
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,100
Didn't you tell me Athens?

452
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,500
A seaport?

453
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
- We have a fine ocean view.
- Oh, that's nice.

454
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,600
Have any brothers
and sisters there?

455
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,200
Lots, half brothers
and half sisters.

456
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,400
What does your father do?
What business is he in?

457
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,300
Ha! He's a deity.

458
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:00,300
I suppose he must miss you.

459
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,500
He didn't want
to see me leave.

460
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,700
I n fact, he was most upset.

461
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Of course.

462
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,800
But a young man must see
the world, so they say.

463
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,700
This is what I told him.

464
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,600
Do you have a girl
back home?

465
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,300
You know how it is.

466
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,900
No, I don't.
( giggling )

467
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,000
Radio: All Central Park units.
All Central Park units.

468
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,500
Escaped from zoo,
one 600 lb. grizzly bear.

469
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
Take caution with animal,
known to be surly and dangerous.

470
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,100
( sirens wailing )

471
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,300
( growling )

472
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,400
( sirens approaching )

473
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,100
I would really like
to see Greece one day.

474
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
I've heard
it's a beautiful country.

475
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,500
Perhaps you will
see it one day.

476
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Will you
show me around?

477
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,500
You like
to climb mountains?

478
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
Well,
I've never done any, um. . .

479
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,000
Have you ever been
on Mt. Olympus?

480
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,300
- I know it very well.
- No kidding!

481
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm not kidding.

482
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,900
When I was a little girl,
I used to read all about it,

483
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,900
and the gods and goddesses who
were supposed to live on top of it,

484
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,400
and I believed it!

485
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,900
It's one of the joys
of being really young.

486
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,500
( growling )

487
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,400
( Helen screaming )

488
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,700
Ooh!

489
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,600
( whinnying )

490
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,800
Ooh!
Aaahh!

491
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,400
( Helen screaming )

492
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,600
Hercules!

493
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,100
Beat him up!

494
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
Aaahh!

495
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,300
Oh, Hercules!

496
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,600
Ooh!

497
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,700
Well, beat him!

498
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
- Wrestling?
- We gotta get money somehow.

499
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,000
Using our muscles is one
of the few ways I could think of

500
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,800
for us to get some dough.

501
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,100
U nless you've got a better idea
on how we're gonna pay the bills

502
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,300
that you've been running up
here at the hotel?

503
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Yes, sir, gents. . .

504
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,600
the wrassling game is. . .
lucrative.

505
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,700
Mr. Dugan promotes the wrestling
matches at the Armory.

506
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,600
Right.

507
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,100
- He saw your picture in the paper.
- Right.

508
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
He read about what you'd done
to that bear.

509
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:36,300
And he brought us a proposition.

510
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm your new partner.

511
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,200
I saw your boy Hercules
wrestle last night.

512
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,100
and he's gonna go places.

513
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
Yeah.

514
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,900
Dugan tells me
you're easy to deal with.

515
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,800
And I hope so,

516
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,000
because here's my contract
to replace yours.

517
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,600
All you gotta do is
sign your name. . .

518
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,600
and here's the dough.

519
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,100
I don't have any contracts
with Hercules.

520
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,900
He's my buddy. . .

521
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,100
we just got each others' word.

522
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,000
It makes it all the easier.

523
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,900
Cuts the red tape.

524
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,200
Sign your name.

525
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,100
Fat Lips, Nitro and me
will take care of everything.

526
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,200
Yeah.

527
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,100
No.

528
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,700
I ain't gonna do that.

529
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,100
Hercules is my friend.
I ain't gonna sell him to nobody.

530
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,000
Not to you, or him,
or him!

531
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,700
Look, that boy of yours
is a comer.

532
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:30,000
With my connections,
that boy's gonna be

533
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,200
world champ in no time.

534
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,700
What's a little runt like you
gonna do for him,

535
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,800
except stand in his way?
And that don't fit in with my plans.

536
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,800
Yeah.

537
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,900
No,
I ain't gonna do it.

538
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,000
Now, look. . .

539
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,900
I'd like to do everything
nice and easy and legal.

540
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,200
But if you wanna get tough,

541
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,700
we can oblige you,
can't we, fellas?

542
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,600
Yeah.

543
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,100
Tell your boy
I'll be seeing him.

544
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,300
( door closes )

545
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
''Hercules. . .

546
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,400
half god, half man,

547
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,000
was the son of J upiter,
or Zeus--

548
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,100
as he was known
to the Greeks--

549
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,100
and a mortal mother
named Alcmene.

550
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,900
As J uno,
Zeus' wife,

551
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,600
was always hostile to
the offspring of her husband,

552
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,400
by mortal mothers,

553
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,800
she declared war against
Hercules from his birth.

554
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,600
She sent two serpents
to destroy him

555
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,600
as he lay in his cradle.

556
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,300
But Hercules strangled them
with his hands.''

557
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Holy moley!

558
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,400
I would speak with Nemesis.

559
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:27,300
My son, Hercules,
who has set himself against me. . .

560
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,400
is out in the world bringing
disrepute to his name.

561
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
He has no business there.

562
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,400
And where he is
is no place for him.

563
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,300
I hear, Great Zeus.

564
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,100
I charge you with a mission,

565
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:45,100
as she who is the avenger
of my displeasures.

566
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,200
I n all things, I obey.

567
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,900
Go down to that continent
known as North America,

568
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,300
to that city
known as New York.

569
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,100
Take with you my wish

570
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:57,000
that Hercules be punished
for setting himself against me,

571
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,300
for demeaning that part
of him which is divine

572
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,600
in rioting among the mortals
of that benighted place.

573
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,500
Great Zeus,

574
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,100
I beg you, hold your anger
against Hercules.

575
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,000
He means no harm.

576
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
He is simple,
and a bit childish.

577
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,800
Give him a chance.

578
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,900
Send me down there first
to persuade him to come back to us,

579
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,400
before you give Nemesis
her task.

580
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,400
- Yes, O Zeus.
- Heed Mercury's plea.

581
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,200
Send Mercury for Hercules

582
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,100
before you charge that dread
Nemesis with her mission.

583
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,200
Venus also adds her voice
in asking Zeus to be patient

584
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,800
and merciful.

585
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,200
I don't wish to be
unduly harsh.

586
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,600
But Hercules has been trying
my patience for centuries.

587
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,600
Woman: Yet be indulgent,
Great Zeus.

588
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,300
Send Mercury
to bring back Hercules.

589
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,900
- Give him this chance.
- Let him stay down there.

590
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,800
He's been an annoyance
from his cradle on.

591
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,400
We all know why
you don't like Hercules.

592
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,900
But surely, Great Zeus will not let
his judgement be affected

593
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,500
- by J uno's malice.
- Malice!?

594
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,400
- How dare you?
- All right. . .

595
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,300
I don't want any arguments.

596
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,200
So be it.

597
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,000
- Mercury. . .
- Great Zeus.

598
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,300
Tell Hercules it is
my wish

599
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,000
he return to Olympus
without delay.

600
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,800
Do not fail.

601
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,300
- Now be gone.
- As Great Zeus commands.

602
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,100
Is it wise, O Zeus,
to do this thing?

603
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,600
If Hercules no longer finds
Olympus to his taste,

604
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,200
then let him stay
where he is.

605
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,800
Those down there will punish him
more than you ever would.

606
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,200
They resent one who is different
from themselves.

607
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,700
They will always try to
destroy him because of it.

608
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,300
It is the habit
with these unhappy mortals.

609
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,200
Hercules is my son,
not yours.

610
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,800
I know you hate him, J uno,

611
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,500
but we do not punish
in hate,

612
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,400
only in sorrow.

613
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,400
I have spoken.

614
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Oh look, you're famous.

615
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,800
That is not Hercules.
And who is that monster

616
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,700
who looks as if he came from
the kingdom of the underworld?

617
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,900
Oh, no.

618
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
This is a motion picture,
a play.

619
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,400
You mustn't take yourself
so seriously.

620
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,000
He doesn't even look like me.
Look.

621
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,400
What are you doing?

622
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, wow!

623
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,900
Does he?

624
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Listen. . .
I really. . .

625
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,900
- Does he?
- I wish you'd put your shirt on.

626
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,800
It isn't supposed
to look like anyone

627
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,000
except the actor
who plays the part!

628
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,900
What is the name
of that imitator?

629
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Who gave him permission
to pretend to be Hercules?

630
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,200
Listen.
Stop joking.

631
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,400
I think. . .
I think we ought to go.

632
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,100
I nsolence.

633
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,300
( church bell chimes )

634
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,200
Hercules: What is that?

635
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,000
It's Atlas
holding up the world.

636
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:39,200
According to Greek mythology,
he was the one who. . .

637
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,200
Atlas?

638
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,600
- Yeah.
- Poor likeness.

639
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,400
You have the oddest
sense of humor.

640
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,400
Half the time I don't know
whether you're joking or not.

641
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,300
Did your mother drop you
on your head as a baby?

642
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
What happened?

643
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,900
Once I strangled two serpents
in the cradle.

644
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,600
Oh. . .

645
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,600
Come along.
I'll show you more of our city.

646
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:04,200
First, let's take a picture
of Atlas.

647
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,500
Okay.

648
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,700
( shutter clicks )

649
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,200
And now of you.

650
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,000
Smile.

651
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,300
This fine food for only
a few small coins?

652
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,400
They who run this place must be
public benefactors.

653
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:36,200
Let's go and get a table.

654
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,000
Very pretty.
I like New York very much.

655
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,700
I'm glad.

656
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,500
Perhaps you'll stay here longer
than you thought you might.

657
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,500
Well,

658
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,700
another hundred years,
at least.

659
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,400
( giggling )

660
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,200
- Greetings, Hercules.
- Mercury.

661
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,700
- What brings you down here?
- You.

662
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,900
- Zeus, he sent you?
- I am here at his command.

663
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,200
Why?

664
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:23,700
To ask you in Zeus' name
to return to Olympus with me.

665
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,700
I don't wish to return yet.

666
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,700
Zeus insists on it.

667
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,200
I like it down here.

668
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,800
Do not defy Zeus.
You can only suffer by it.

669
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
He's all the time
nagging me.

670
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,100
Mercury: It is out of the love
he bears you.

671
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:38,200
When did you see
my father last?

672
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,700
About five minutes ago.

673
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:42,000
How did you leave things
in Olympus?

674
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,700
About the same.
Everybody misses you.

675
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,600
Hercules: J uno, too?

676
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,000
Well, you know J uno
and her jealousy

677
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,400
of every woman
Zeus looks twice at.

678
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,400
Venus especially asked me
to give you her best wishes.

679
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,400
Tell Zeus I'll come back
when I'm ready.

680
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,200
I wouldn't want to do that.
You know how handy he is

681
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,100
in throwing those thunderbolts
when he's angry.

682
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:04,000
I'm not worried about
Zeus' thunderbolts down here.

683
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:07,500
Zeus has another instrument
to punish those who offend him. . .

684
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,400
Nemesis.

685
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,900
He wouldn't send her
after me.

686
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:13,400
It was only at the solicitation
of your friends

687
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,700
that he sent me in her place
to make this plea for your return.

688
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,400
Why can't the old man
let me alone?

689
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
For the first time
in 2,000 years

690
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,200
I'm enjoying myself
and he's trying to spoil it.

691
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:26,500
This is no place for you.

692
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,400
Everything is changing.

693
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,700
Mortal man has no more belief
in the old ways.

694
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,800
I'm enjoying myself,
just the same.

695
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,800
- You are living a fallacy.
- It doesn't hurt me.

696
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,200
Such overconfidence
could be ruinous.

697
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,700
I'm going
to take a shower.

698
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:46,300
Please, Hercules,
come back to Olympus.

699
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,200
Now you're reasonable,
Mercury.

700
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,600
And you're also
my half brother.

701
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,600
What harm am I doing
down here?

702
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,300
- You could do great harm.
- Harm to whom?

703
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,000
- Yourself.
- What are you talking about?

704
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,700
Hercules can only be
Hercules.

705
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,300
You are confusing these mortals
with your behavior.

706
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,200
Hercules: Ha!
I know a theater

707
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,200
on the street named
Broadway.

708
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,400
There's a man
who plays me so well.

709
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,100
They shower money on him.

710
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,000
It proves they know me.

711
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,800
I must get back to Olympus.
I cannot delay.

712
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,700
Zeus would hold it against me.
Are you coming back or not?

713
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:23,900
No.

714
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,500
Is that the message you would
have me deliver to Zeus?

715
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,700
I will come sometime,
but not right now.

716
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,600
Then I fear for you,
Hercules.

717
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:36,000
Such obstinacy can have
only grave consequences.

718
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,000
Give my regards to Venus.

719
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,900
Right.

720
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,300
She will be distressed to know
that you are defying your father.

721
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,900
I'm not defying him. I just want
to stay here for a while.

722
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,900
Farewell, then.

723
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,700
I carry your words back
to Olympus with a heavy heart.

724
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,400
If you will not take
my advice,

725
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,200
then heed my caution:
beware of Nemesis.

726
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,000
Goodbye, my half brother.

727
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,200
I'm sure he meant well.

728
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,300
But, but. . .
he. . .

729
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,300
( stammering )

730
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,800
Ooohh!

731
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,300
Helen: You know what
I think?

732
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,800
I think he's slightly
demented.

733
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,000
Either that, or he's the world's
most dedicated joker.

734
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,400
Perhaps he's suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

735
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:04,000
His name is Hercules,
so he thinks he's Hercules.

736
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,900
What's so terrible about that?

737
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,800
We've heard of people
who think they're Napoleon.

738
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,800
U h-huh.

739
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,000
But they're in institutions.

740
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,300
The young man's aberration
may be a mild megalomania.

741
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,900
I don't care.

742
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,400
I like him.
Even if he is a bit crazy.

743
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,800
So do I , even if he did
crack two of my ribs.

744
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:25,200
A Greek peasant with delusions
of mythological divinity.

745
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,500
Fascinating.

746
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,700
( doorbell rings )

747
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,700
Open it up. . .
I've seen it, I've seen it.

748
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,900
He opens up. . .

749
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:38,000
I seen it!
I seen it!

750
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,100
- I seen it.
- Pretzi, how are you?

751
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,500
I seen it.
I seen it.

752
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,900
He. . . he. . .
he flung himself

753
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,200
right out the window--
head first--

754
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,900
from the 23rd floor!
And then he fell straight up!

755
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,700
What are you talking about,
Pretzi?

756
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,600
I seen it
with my own eyes.

757
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
What did you see, Pretzi?

758
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,700
He called him, ''Mercury.''

759
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,500
They were talking
about his old man.

760
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,000
Seems he come over here
to get him to come home.

761
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:06,000
But he don't wanna come home,

762
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,700
so Mercury throws himself
out the window,

763
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,500
straight up into the sky!

764
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Take it easy, Pretzi.

765
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,000
- Get him a drink, Helen.
- No, please, no.

766
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:17,900
No booze, no.
I think that's what did it.

767
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,200
I don't know. I seen it. . .
clear as daylight.

768
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,700
- A cup of coffee may help.
- Right, I'll get it.

769
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,200
Now, Pretzi, I presume
you are talking about Hercules.

770
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,900
Yeah, Hercules.
Right.

771
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,900
Did you have anything
to drink?

772
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,200
Well, I . . .

773
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,300
I might have had a couple
of snorts.

774
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,800
And how much is a couple?

775
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,100
A pint.

776
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,700
A pint?

777
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,500
Well. . .
a fifth.

778
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,800
Relax. A cup of black coffee,
and everything will be fine.

779
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,100
Holy moley!
I tell ya. . .

780
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,400
I've never seen anything
like this before in my whole life.

781
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,900
( thunder )

782
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,700
That was the answer Hercules
gave you to bring to me?

783
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:06,500
It was not so insolent
as Zeus imagines.

784
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
I n fact, Hercules spoke of you
with affection.

785
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,500
- Yet he defied my command.
- But not in so many words.

786
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,800
He said he would come back,
but not just yet.

787
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,500
He dares to temporize with me!

788
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,800
I'll blast him!

789
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,000
Nemesis. . .

790
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,700
come here!

791
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,900
Nemesis. . .

792
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,400
Can I talk with you
a moment, Nemesis?

793
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,900
Make it brief, O wife to Zeus.
I am on a mission.

794
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:45,500
What punishment did my
husband decree for Hercules?

795
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,300
It is for him to tell you,
not I .

796
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,100
It is for you to tell me
when I ask!

797
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,000
Am I not wife to Zeus?

798
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,300
I order you!

799
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,400
I am to convey Hercules to
the underworld kingdom of Pluto

800
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:03,600
where he is to remain
for a hundred years.

801
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,000
What kind of a punishment
is that?

802
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
Hercules will have
the time of his life

803
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,800
roistering about
with that lecher.

804
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,500
Pluto is the king
of all evil pleasures.

805
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,600
If it is Zeus' thought that
Hercules should reside in hell. . .

806
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,500
I have a keener one for him.

807
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:27,400
Let him stay where he is.

808
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,100
But Earth is where
Hercules wishes to be.

809
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,200
Yes. . .

810
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,400
but as Hercules.

811
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,900
- I don't understand.
- With all his great strength,

812
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,200
it sets him apart
from other mortals.

813
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,900
They might even make
him king because of it.

814
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,400
They have no kings
where Hercules is.

815
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,300
They're called ''presidents.''

816
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,300
A king by any other name,

817
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,600
in his heart still thinks
of himself as king.

818
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,200
J uno delays me.
I must leave.

819
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,500
What does she have in mind?

820
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,800
Hercules' divinity.

821
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,900
His divinity?

822
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,800
Since he seems to like it so well
where he presently is,

823
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,800
I shall give him a taste
of what it truly means.

824
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,500
He shall become one of
those wretched mortals

825
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,500
he finds it so fascinating
to be among.

826
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,500
But Hercules is a demigod.

827
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,800
Thanks to my husband's
philanderings.

828
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,500
I can't take away Hercules'
divinity permanently. . .

829
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,100
but I can make him
as other men for a while. . .

830
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:37,700
as long as the effects from
the powder in this ring last.

831
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,500
Hope for the best.

832
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:44,000
Open the face of this ring.

833
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,100
Pour the powder within
into Hercules' drink.

834
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,100
Then he will become
as other men,

835
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,200
no better,

836
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,000
and as vulnerable
as any of them.

837
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:56,800
It could mean that
Hercules could. . .

838
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
- Yes.
- He could get killed.

839
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,700
It might.

840
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,200
J uno, I dare not.

841
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,600
I cannot take part
in undermining. . .

842
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,000
the will of the gods.

843
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,700
Do my bidding. . .

844
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:16,700
or when I have Zeus
here in private

845
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,600
I might tell him
a few things about you.

846
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,600
And one more thing. . .

847
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,700
on your way back,
make a little detour.

848
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,800
Go see Pluto.

849
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,800
I have a message for him.

850
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,200
Pluto: Forgive the barking.
It's only Cerberus.

851
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,300
Nemesis: Seems to have
quite an argument.

852
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,900
He does that sometimes
when he's angry at himself.

853
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,500
It's those three heads,
you know.

854
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,800
How have you been,
Pluto?

855
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,300
Pretty nifty, except it's been
a hell of a day.

856
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,600
A new shipload.
Ha! Look who's here.

857
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,600
I'd ask you in,
but it's a mess.

858
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,200
Thanks, but I wouldn't
have time for just a visit.

859
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,200
You say that Hercules
is the same as

860
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,900
all those foolish mortals
he finds himself among?

861
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,800
Temporarily.

862
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,600
Zeus has decreed
that Hercules should spend

863
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,600
the next hundred years
down here.

864
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,300
There has been an argument
between the two of them.

865
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,100
And so J uno, um. . .

866
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,700
wants you to have the opportunity
to make the most of this.

867
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,500
What a triumph! What a coup!
What a feather in my cap!

868
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,800
To snatch the soul
of a demigod!

869
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,700
- When can I expect Hercules?
- That's the problem.

870
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,300
He refuses to obey Zeus.

871
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,100
Then he won't come.
Drat!

872
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:08,700
Not voluntarily.

873
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,700
He must bring him
involuntarily.

874
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,500
And J uno has. . .

875
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,600
facilitated matters.

876
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,200
Surely J uno realizes
that I am no murderer.

877
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,800
- I only punish.
- She understands that,

878
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,400
of course.

879
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,500
But she also knows
that you are ingenious.

880
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:30,300
And what she can't
accomplish by one means,

881
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,200
she is sure that you are
likely to achieve by another.

882
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,700
You know, that is true.

883
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,300
I always thought of myself
as a god of ideas.

884
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,200
Then I'll leave the matter
in your hands.

885
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,700
Goodbye.

886
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:44,500
Goodbye.

887
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,100
Pluto: I didn't mind climbing
all those stairs to get here,

888
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,100
but heights make me dizzy.

889
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm not accustomed
to the altitude.

890
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,200
( chuckles )

891
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,500
Have you decided?

892
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,600
I don't care what Zeus
has decreed.

893
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm not coming with you.

894
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,300
- Some other century, perhaps?
- It'll be safer for you.

895
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,700
Safer? Hercules is a god,
and safe wherever he goes.

896
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,400
Things can change.

897
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,800
You're being ridiculous.

898
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,600
J ust listen to me for a minute.

899
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,500
You'll enjoy yourself.
You'll have a hell of a time.

900
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,600
I don't know what the occasion was
that prompted this influx of. . .

901
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,000
beautiful women. . .
- Go away.

902
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,800
- You bother me.
- J ust listen.

903
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,200
I n this briefcase
I happen to have a contract

904
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,700
that was drawn up by the best
legal minds in the world,

905
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,600
who at the moment are involuntarily
the recipients of my hospitality.

906
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,900
What is it to me?

907
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,200
I mean if you play
your cards right

908
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,100
I can see that you can get
any one of those dames, women,

909
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,500
who might tickle your,
eh, fancy.

910
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,200
So just sign
on the dotted line,

911
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,000
and I'll take care of
everything else.

912
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,100
Why don't you
go back to hell!

913
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,300
You've been away
too long already.

914
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,200
Who is taking care of things?

915
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,300
Who is feeding Cerberus?

916
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:30,700
How did you get here?
You always shun the light.

917
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,900
Nosy parker.
Did you notice how dark it was?

918
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,200
- So this is your doing?
- Um-hmm.

919
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,800
How about signing
on the dotted line?

920
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,500
No. If you don't stop
annoying me, I . . .

921
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,000
Listen, I'm not. . .

922
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:46,600
I'm not afraid of you.

923
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,500
Hey, that's terrific,

924
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,500
but I'm also a god.

925
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,700
- I can try.
- You can try? Listen.

926
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,100
I'll see you later.

927
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,400
We'll be in touch.

928
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,100
You're gonna. . .
hear from me.

929
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,300
I'll see you again sometime. . .

930
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,100
when you're run down.

931
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:26,200
Said on the phone
he'd meet us here.

932
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,500
Said we'd recognize him
by the briefcase he'd be carrying.

933
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,300
Here he comes.

934
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:43,600
You weren't kidding about what
you said on the phone, were ya?

935
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,900
Certainly not.

936
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,300
Sure you'll be able
to handle it?

937
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,300
Man: Twenty thousand dollars?

938
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,400
5 to 1 .

939
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:58,300
Okay, pal, it's a bet.

940
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,700
You're laying 20 grand
at 5 to 1

941
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,600
on Hercules to lose?

942
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,900
The money.

943
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
What's your name?

944
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,600
Where do you hang out?
Where can I reach you?

945
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,900
Don't worry about that.
All in good time.

946
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,200
We shall meet again.

947
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:25,500
Mmmmm. . .
Be assured of that.

948
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,800
Well, goodbye. . .

949
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,700
for the present.

950
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,200
Till next time.

951
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,600
I don't like
that guy's looks.

952
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:45,200
He gives me the creeps.

953
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,900
He's dangerous.

954
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,200
I wouldn't welsh on him
if I was you.

955
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,400
What's to welsh?

956
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,000
Hercules is a cinch to win,
right?

957
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,600
If you say so.

958
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,400
He'll walk into a room
he won't walk out of

959
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,300
if he don't come through
for me.

960
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,600
Twenty grand, huh?

961
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,800
That's a lot of dough.

962
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,700
Figure this guy knows
something we don't know?

963
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
What could he know?

964
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,700
He's a long shot plunger!

965
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,800
( laughing )

966
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,600
- Disturbing you?
- No, dear, come in.

967
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,800
Did you see
today's newspaper?

968
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,300
Not yet.
Anything of special interest?

969
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,300
An item
in Wesley Watkins' column.

970
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,500
Listen. . .

971
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,000
''New Yorkers are talking
about the claim

972
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,300
of champion wrestling contender,
Hercules the Great

973
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,500
that he's the strongest man
in the world.''

974
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,500
I wouldn't be inclined
to dispute that.

975
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,000
Someone does. Listen.

976
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,700
''Foremost among those
to dispute this statement

977
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,200
is circus strongman,
Monstro the Magnificent.

978
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,600
He declares himself
as willing to put up

979
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,200
$1 0,000 on the outcome
of a weightlifting contest.''

980
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,800
There's a man with
his work cut out for him.

981
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,500
''Broadway scuttlebutt has it

982
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,200
that the matter
may be settled

983
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,700
on a national variety
television program.''

984
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:27,100
I personally have no doubt
as to the outcome.

985
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,400
Hi!
Came to wish you luck.

986
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,400
Thank you.

987
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,300
Father's out front
rooting for you, too.

988
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,000
I'm glad for it.

989
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,700
Man: How's it going, pal?

990
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,800
- Greetings.
- All set for the big match?

991
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,800
- It doesn't bother me.
- You'll take him, all right.

992
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,000
- What can stop me?
- Glad to hear you say that.

993
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,200
I got a lot of dough spread out
on those muscles of yours.

994
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:52,000
- Don't worry.
- I'm not worrying.

995
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,300
J ust reminding you that if
anything goes wrong,

996
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,300
I'm not gonna like losing
all that money,

997
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,300
and you won't like it,
either.

998
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,800
I understand. It is not pleasant
to lose money

999
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,000
once one becomes
accustomed to its use.

1000
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,300
Yeah. I don't back losers. . .

1001
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,700
ever!

1002
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,100
Very practical.

1003
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,400
So don't lose.

1004
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,900
Who was that?

1005
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,400
I believe
he was threatening you.

1006
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,600
- He was?
- Yes!

1007
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,500
If you don't win,
he means to harm you.

1008
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,700
Who can harm Hercules?

1009
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,800
He's a bad guy, Herc.
Gee. . .

1010
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,100
I wish we didn't have nothing
to do with him.

1011
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,900
You're okay, ain't you?

1012
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,100
I'm fine.

1013
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,300
PA: Hercules the Great
on stage!

1014
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,100
Well, that's you.

1015
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,000
I'll see you later.
Good luck.

1016
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,000
Thanks a lot.
Okay, Herc,

1017
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:47,700
you're all ready.
Remember everything I told you.

1018
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:50,800
You won't forget. Whatever you do,
don't get nervous.

1019
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,700
I mean, just. . . just. . .
keep calm.

1020
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:55,400
Don't strain yourself because
you could get a hernia.

1021
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,400
Whatever you do, Herc,
just stay calm.

1022
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,500
And listen, Herc,

1023
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,000
watch out for Monstro. . .

1024
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:05,800
Wasn't he something,
folks?

1025
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,300
And now we have a special
treat for all you girls and guys.

1026
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:12,300
An exhibition of
the defense of manly art.

1027
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,100
Speculation throughout
the city has been rife.

1028
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,400
Who is the strongest?
Monstro the Magnificent?

1029
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,400
( cheers and applause )

1030
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,300
Ooh, hey!

1031
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,800
Or Hercules the Great?
Let's bring Herc on.

1032
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,900
You go out there
and get him.

1033
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,500
Remember what I taught you.
Don't forget, now.

1034
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:37,400
There he goes.
Very glad to have you on the show.

1035
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,500
Whew!

1036
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,700
Now this contest of strength
will begin with the challenger,

1037
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,800
Monstro the Magnificent,
who will snatch, press. . .

1038
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,200
- That's ''clean and jerk.''
- I'm sorry.

1039
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:51,200
Who will clean and jerk
barbells weighing. . .

1040
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,600
- 500 pounds?
- 500.

1041
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,200
500 pounds!

1042
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,700
( applause )

1043
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,600
( drum roll )

1044
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,600
Host: Let's give him
a great big hand!

1045
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,400
Monstro the Magnificent.

1046
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:15,100
( applause )

1047
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,700
And now Hercules the Great.
500 pounds.

1048
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:21,400
( applause )

1049
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,700
( applause )

1050
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,200
And now,
item number two.

1051
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
7 50 pounds.

1052
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,300
Monstro the Magnificent.
Let's give him a hand.

1053
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,900
( applause )

1054
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,300
( drum roll )

1055
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:10,900
Not now, dum-dum.

1056
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,400
Wonderful.

1057
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,700
And now, Hercules the Great.

1058
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:17,000
7 50 pounds.

1059
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,800
( applause )

1060
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,600
For Hercules, 7 50 pounds,
ladies and gentlemen.

1061
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,500
( applause )

1062
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,700
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
in this struggle of the titans,

1063
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:00,100
One thousand pounds!

1064
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,500
Monstro the Magnificent.

1065
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,400
Let's hear it for Monstro!

1066
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,100
( applause )

1067
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,300
Host: Ladies and gentlemen,
Monstro the Magnificent!

1068
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,500
( applause )

1069
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:29,400
Whoa, look at that!
Look at that!

1070
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,600
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Monstro the Magnificent!

1071
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:35,400
Host: And now,
Hercules the Great.

1072
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,600
One thousand pounds.

1073
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Double cross.

1074
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,600
( groaning )

1075
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's have a hand for Hercules.

1076
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:28,400
A real effort.
A real effort.

1077
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,200
Host: And now the winner,
Monstro the Magnificent!

1078
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,500
But, but what happened?

1079
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,300
I don't know!
I could not lift it.

1080
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,200
My strength,
it seemed to have gone.

1081
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,100
Come on,
we gotta get out of here!

1082
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,800
There's no time to get dressed.
We'll go this way.

1083
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:48,100
Down the fire escape!

1084
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:51,600
Let's hear it,
ladies and gentlemen. Come on!

1085
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,300
Let's hear it for Monstro!

1086
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,200
( applause )

1087
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,400
Father, this is terrible.
We've got to go!

1088
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,500
Why, Helen?

1089
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,500
- Come on.
- What's happened?

1090
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,100
Hercules is in trouble.

1091
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:07,600
Although that represents
no novelty, I find it forbidding.

1092
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,500
He brought it on himself.

1093
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,200
One thing
I do not understand. . .

1094
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:17,600
I did not decree that Hercules
should be bereft of his divinity.

1095
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,500
It was my edict that
he be sent to Pluto's kingdom

1096
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,700
for a hundred years.

1097
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:25,500
How, then, has this
other thing happened?

1098
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,400
Can nobody tell me?

1099
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,100
- Eros!
- Yes, sir, Zeus.

1100
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,700
Find Nemesis.
Bring her to me.

1101
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,400
At once,
my liege Zeus.

1102
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,100
He should have been
back here by now.

1103
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,500
His duds are here.

1104
01:08:57,500 --> 01:09:00,900
Which means he ain't
coming back here!

1105
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:03,400
Outside!
Get the boys!

1106
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,700
Get the boys.

1107
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,300
Get the boys.

1108
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,600
There goes the dame.

1109
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,400
The big phony and the runt
must be inside. Let's go.

1110
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,200
They're probably on the floor.

1111
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:45,500
Follow them.
Don't lose them.

1112
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,000
She left without
saying goodbye.

1113
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But don't you see
what she's doing?

1114
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:04,700
She trying to draw them away
so we can escape.

1115
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:06,600
You said those men
were dangerous.

1116
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,700
Dangerous!
Boy, I'll say.

1117
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,300
- H urry!
- Where you going?

1118
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:14,900
We have to stop those men.

1119
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,400
On foot? You're gonna
chase them on foot?

1120
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:19,800
- With the chariot.
- Chariot? What chariot?

1121
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,900
That's not a chariot.
What are you doing?

1122
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,400
Now he's done it!

1123
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,500
Man: Hey, come back
with my chariot!

1124
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,800
Hey, Mister!
Wait for your sauerkraut!

1125
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,700
Man: Hey ''Muscles,'' that ain't
the way to Disneyland!

1126
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,500
( cars honking )

1127
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,400
We'll make mincemeat
out of those guys.

1128
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,300
- Coming up to a red light.
- Forget about the light.

1129
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,500
Cut them off at the zoo.

1130
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:05,300
Don't let those punks
get away.

1131
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,900
Where is everybody?

1132
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,600
( car honking )

1133
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,500
Where did that monster go
with my chariot?!

1134
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,400
I want my chariot.

1135
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:19,700
Helen: We're out of gas!

1136
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,800
Let's get in there!

1137
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:29,700
Hercules doesn't flee
from anybody.

1138
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:31,600
Come on, Herc!
No time to argue!

1139
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,000
Zeus sent for me?

1140
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:47,400
When I ordered you
down to Earth,

1141
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:49,300
did I not charge you to see
that Hercules

1142
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:50,800
was delivered
to the realm of Pluto?

1143
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,400
- It is as Zeus says.
- Then, what happened?

1144
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,900
How is it that Hercules was
instead deprived of his divinity,

1145
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,100
his strength,

1146
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:02,000
and finds himself in his
present mortal predicament?

1147
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,500
Well. . .?

1148
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:07,900
Well!?

1149
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:12,400
I was sent on another mission.
The substitute.

1150
01:15:12,500 --> 01:15:15,300
Who gave you another mission
to supersede that of mine?

1151
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:19,900
Speak up, or I will blast you
where you stand!

1152
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,400
( tires squeal )

1153
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:32,500
Here comes Tony.

1154
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:34,600
- Where's all the other guys?
- I n the other cars.

1155
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,700
Okay, you take a couple of boys
and go in that door,

1156
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:39,200
all the other guys,
come with me.

1157
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,300
Where are we going?

1158
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,300
That way!

1159
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,500
Now, Nemesis,
speak or I'll. . . !

1160
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,400
No! No, Mighty Zeus.

1161
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,400
I beg you!

1162
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,300
It was J uno.

1163
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,400
She bade me do what I did.

1164
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,400
So, interfering again.

1165
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,900
I've told you I will not tolerate
your everlasting interference.

1166
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
I thought it best,
to save a lot of trouble.

1167
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,000
I will discuss this
with you later.

1168
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,300
Zeus, will you not save
Hercules?

1169
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,000
Let him abide
by the consequences

1170
01:17:12,100 --> 01:17:14,400
of his own folly
and obstinacy.

1171
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:30,300
Oh, no. Herc!

1172
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,300
Hercules is in great peril.

1173
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:47,000
If Zeus does not relent,
there's nothing we can do.

1174
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:49,100
- There is.
- What?

1175
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,100
We may send aid
to Hercules.

1176
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,400
We?
Send help to Hercules?

1177
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:56,200
You know where to find them.

1178
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,300
And they'll listen to you.
I know they will.

1179
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:01,200
- Who?
- Atlas and Samson.

1180
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,100
Hercules! Get up!
Come up here!

1181
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:24,200
- Come on, Hercules.
- Hercules, get up!

1182
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,500
He's not coming.

1183
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,200
Are you all right, boy?

1184
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:37,400
You all right?

1185
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:47,200
Go get them!
Come on, go get them!

1186
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,300
Who sent Atlas and Samson
to Hercules' aid?

1187
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:32,300
Is it not enough that Hercules
has been causing

1188
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,100
all that trouble
by himself?

1189
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:36,700
Call those other two away,
at once.

1190
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:42,400
Mercury. . .?

1191
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,700
- Zeus?
- Was it you?

1192
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,900
It was I .

1193
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:54,800
How dare you
go above my head?

1194
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,900
I feared
for Hercules' safety.

1195
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:00,900
Bereft of his strength,
he's as helpless as a child

1196
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
in the world of mortal men.

1197
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,300
It is not to be borne.

1198
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,800
Hercules treated as a common
mortal by those scoundrels.

1199
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,800
Then save him, Mighty Zeus!

1200
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:14,600
He deserves all he's getting.

1201
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:18,300
When I want your opinion,
I'll ask for it.

1202
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,100
Hercules is a son of Zeus.

1203
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,200
I n treating him as they do,

1204
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:28,600
those scoundrels down there
show disrespect for his father.

1205
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,500
Then save him,
Great Zeus,

1206
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,500
even if it is only because
he is your son.

1207
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,700
No mortal shall ever triumph
over a son of Zeus!

1208
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,300
( thunder )

1209
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:03,700
I don't see nothing.

1210
01:22:03,700 --> 01:22:05,800
It's all very dark
in there.

1211
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,600
Fire torpedo!

1212
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:11,400
Aw, you gotta put
a dime in.

1213
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,000
Forget it.

1214
01:22:16,300 --> 01:22:18,200
You can see
all the way to Jersey!

1215
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:20,500
It's really something, huh?

1216
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:22,600
I've never been up here,
you know.

1217
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,700
Kind of makes you
feel like. . .

1218
01:22:24,700 --> 01:22:27,200
some sort of god
or something.

1219
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,400
Too bad it's a little
cloudy today.

1220
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,900
Well, you can still see
pretty far.

1221
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,700
I can see the whole river.

1222
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:38,900
Look at that big boat
down there.

1223
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:42,000
You know, Herc,

1224
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,500
that looks like the boat
you were on.

1225
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,400
Take a look at it, Herc,
I think it's. . .

1226
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:49,100
Hey, Herc?

1227
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,700
Where'd you go, Herc?

1228
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:52,800
I have been willful.

1229
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,900
I have been disobedient.

1230
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:58,700
Mighty Zeus has more wisdom
than Hercules.

1231
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,200
He knew better
what is best for him.

1232
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:03,000
Please, Mighty Zeus, relent.

1233
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,500
You'll be sorry.

1234
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,000
Zeus has only to speak now

1235
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:12,000
for Hercules to obey.

1236
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:13,800
( thunder )

1237
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,700
Herc?

1238
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:22,600
Where'd you go, Herc?

1239
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:24,200
Hey, Herc!

1240
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,600
Herc!

1241
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,900
H uh, strongest guy
in the world. . .

1242
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:11,500
tying up with a nothing
like me.

1243
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,000
Imagine. . .

1244
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:17,700
He really made me feel
like something. . .

1245
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,700
a half-pint like me.

1246
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:23,100
I ain't never gonna
forget him.

1247
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,000
Never.

1248
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:30,600
Only, where did he go?

1249
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,800
( jazz music )

1250
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Radio: Don't grieve,
my friend.

1251
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,900
I n the memory
that leaves you,

1252
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,200
separation may have
a quiet happiness all its own.

1253
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,500
Herc?

1254
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,600
We are friends, you and I .

1255
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:48,600
And nothing can
take that from us.

1256
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,900
Herc?

1257
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,100
Herc!
Where are you, Herc?

1258
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:56,700
What are you doing
in my radio?

1259
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,100
Herc. . .

1260
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:00,300
It's me! It's Pretzi!

1261
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:04,600
Why did you take a powder like that?
Why did you just leave?

1262
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,400
I didn't say anything
out of line, did I?

1263
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:12,500
Or do nothing?
Did I , Herc?

1264
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:15,500
I enjoyed knowing you,
my little friend.

1265
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:18,200
Gee, Herc.

1266
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,400
Ain't I never gonna
see you again?

1267
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:22,700
Ain't you never
coming back?

1268
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,800
Even for a visit?

1269
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:26,800
'Cause if you ain't,

1270
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,000
it's sure gonna be
lonesome for me again.

1271
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:34,100
Herc, we really did
all them things, didn't we?

1272
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,900
I didn't just imagine
all them things, did I?

1273
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,800
It wasn't like what
the head shrinkers call,

1274
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,200
''wishful thinking,''
was it, Herc?

1275
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,500
Radio: Any time you wish me
to be with you,

1276
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,000
all you need to do
is think of me.

1277
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,500
and there I shall be,

1278
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:54,100
in your mind
and in your heart. . .

1279
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,100
for as long as
you want me to be,

1280
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,900
as long as you need me.

1281
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,700
Radio: Due to temporary
atmospheric difficulties,

1282
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,900
we were interrupted
in our broadcast.

1283
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,200
We resume. . .

1284
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:07,000
Herc?

1285
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,100
Herc?

1286
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:16,400
''Any time you need me,

1287
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,900
any time you want me,

1288
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,800
just think of me,

1289
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,800
and I'll be there

1290
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,500
for as long as
you want me to.''

1291
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,800
Yeah.

1292
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,500
I think I'll eat an apple.

1293
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,100
And this is what I saw
on the world below.

1294
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,100
It all sounds
revoltingly noisy.

1295
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,800
Leave me, now.

1296
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:52,000
I would think
on what I've been told.

1297
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,800
You, too, my love.

1298
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,000
( screaming )

1299
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,600
( screaming continues )
