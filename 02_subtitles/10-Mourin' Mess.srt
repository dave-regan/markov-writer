1
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:32,800
There you are!

2
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:34,674
You're just in time.

3
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:38,807
I'm trying out a few recipes from
my new Betty Croaker Cookbook.

4
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,645
I hope you like shish kebab.

5
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,512
Damn! It isn't ready yet.

6
00:01:44,589 --> 00:01:46,352
Bob's still moving.

7
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,862
Tonight's foul feast...

8
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,558
will begin with mashed potatoes...

9
00:01:54,632 --> 00:01:57,396
then move on to some shrieking duck...

10
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:00,437
and finish with a nice kill-basa.

11
00:02:01,105 --> 00:02:03,573
I call this tasty tidbit...

12
00:02:03,808 --> 00:02:05,639
""Mournin' Mess.""

13
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,960
I brought you some fresh bed sheets.

14
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:08,964
Evening edition.

15
00:03:14,712 --> 00:03:16,373
Shit, look at that.

16
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:20,645
Oh, fuck the hooch, man.
I'm taking you to a hospital.

17
00:03:20,718 --> 00:03:22,686
-Come on.
-No. I hate fucking hospitals.

18
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:26,521
I got too many good rounds left in me yet.

19
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:31,022
Fuck it, Dancer. You're going down
for the count, and I'm calling for help.

20
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:50,774
Bubba?

21
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:52,972
That you, man?

22
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:59,282
Who's out there?

23
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,356
Listen here. I'm a former middleweight.

24
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,354
Fucking doctor.

25
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,565
Dancer?

26
00:04:19,344 --> 00:04:20,868
Shit! Dancer!

27
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:29,010
Okay, I got you. I got you!

28
00:04:34,158 --> 00:04:36,752
What the hell is going on down there?

29
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:38,762
I'm calling the police!

30
00:05:04,956 --> 00:05:06,753
Oh, shit.

31
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,184
What's wrong?

32
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:15,261
You got to leave now.

33
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,397
I thought we were gonna
spend the day together.

34
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:22,162
Well, that was Jack Daniel's talking.

35
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:26,243
Dale Sweeney's telling you
to cop a broom.

36
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,073
What?

37
00:05:34,819 --> 00:05:36,081
Oh, shit.

38
00:05:38,156 --> 00:05:40,454
You think you can just
chew women up at night...

39
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,152
and spit them out in the morning!

40
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:46,026
Baby, in my line of work,
you don't have time for long meals.

41
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:48,122
Keep your paws off of me!

42
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,026
You make me sick!

43
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,429
You motherfucker!

44
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:53,765
Fuck you!

45
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:57,569
You should be living in a mobile home
'cause you have no class, you idiot!

46
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:04,504
None ofthe problems
which plague our society...

47
00:06:04,582 --> 00:06:07,915
can be fully overcome without
the cooperation ofprivate enterprise.

48
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,886
I and six of my fellow citizens
are here today...

49
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:13,788
not simply
because we believe that statement...

50
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:16,520
but also
because we share a common past.

51
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:19,189
We were all once homeless...

52
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,930
and are homeless no longer.

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,434
We feel it is time to repay our city...

54
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:29,030
for providing us with the opportunity
to help ourselves.

55
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,433
Therefore, we ha ve banded together
to form...

56
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:35,309
the Grateful Homeless Outcasts
and Unwanteds Layaway Society.

57
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,878
The Grateful Homeless Society, for short.

58
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,684
You're late again. I guess the great
Dale Sweeney really has lost his touch.

59
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,387
I could lose my eyesight
and still run circles around you, Climsky.

60
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:52,952
Who broke the insurance scandal
last month?

61
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,657
Friends are starting to call me
Scoop Climsky.

62
00:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,097
I didn't know your friends could read.

63
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,691
Face it, Sweeney, your days
are numbered, and I'm on your ass.

64
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:02,539
Stay on your own ass for a while, putz.

65
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,043
So, after a lifetime ofpain...

66
00:07:09,113 --> 00:07:12,082
there will be an eternity of dignity.

67
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,445
Now, in keeping with
my usual demure nature, I will...

68
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:19,718
defer all questions
to our society's spokesperson...

69
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,519
Ms. Jess Gilchrist.

70
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,584
Excuse me. Ms. Gilchrist?

71
00:07:24,662 --> 00:07:25,822
Thank you, Mr. Copard.

72
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:28,457
Shouldn't you be spending money
above the ground...

73
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:30,057
instead of underneath it?

74
00:07:30,134 --> 00:07:31,658
We don 't think so.

75
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,727
Why throw money at the dead...

76
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:36,432
when you could use it
to help the homeless who are living?

77
00:07:36,507 --> 00:07:37,735
That's a good point.

78
00:07:37,808 --> 00:07:39,776
The Grateful Homeless Society feels...

79
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,074
that there are many
existing organizations...

80
00:07:42,146 --> 00:07:44,876
that currently provide aid to the living.

81
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:47,577
Beacons in the night,
as Mr. Copard liked to--

82
00:07:47,652 --> 00:07:49,882
Would it be safe to say
that there aren't enough of these...

83
00:07:49,954 --> 00:07:52,514
beacons to keep you
from opening up this place?

84
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,582
That is your interpretation
of the situation. Yes.

85
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,128
How many members
does the society have, anyway?

86
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:07,068
I only wish
you could be the first recipient...

87
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,933
of the Grateful Homeless Society's
generosity.

88
00:08:10,007 --> 00:08:13,875
They cut my electricity.
My alarm did not go off.

89
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,836
Well, maybe you should buy
an alcohol-powered generator.

90
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:19,178
That way you could
urinate into it every morning and have...

91
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,480
-enough electricity for the whole day.
-That's hilarious.

92
00:08:21,552 --> 00:08:22,814
Give me a break, Tillman.

93
00:08:22,887 --> 00:08:25,185
No, ""break"" isn't exactly the term,
Mr. Sweeney.

94
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:26,746
Try severance.

95
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:28,257
-Severance?
-Yes.

96
00:08:28,326 --> 00:08:30,658
I'm not gonna play
this crap game with you anymore.

97
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:33,526
Will Sweeney show up,
or is he too busy getting his oil changed?

98
00:08:33,598 --> 00:08:36,066
Please, don't do this to me now. Please.

99
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,033
All right.
How about five seconds from now?

100
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:41,902
Elaine...

101
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:43,565
I mean, come on.

102
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,076
Time's up. You're fired.

103
00:08:46,978 --> 00:08:48,343
Okay. Fine.

104
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:52,681
It's no skin off my nose.
I'll just go hit up The Herald.

105
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,911
Great. You want a recommendation?

106
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:58,319
I mean, it's a great chance
to cripple the competition.

107
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,119
Nice place you got here.

108
00:09:39,196 --> 00:09:41,664
It makes the street look like
the fucking White House.

109
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:44,326
Look, man. I got nothing to give you, man.

110
00:09:44,402 --> 00:09:46,734
You got fingers. You got a hand.

111
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,995
What's the matter?

112
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:51,803
Don't you recognize the homeless killer?

113
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:54,135
Shit.

114
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:56,907
I need you to use those fingers
and those hands of yours...

115
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,642
to do a little ink-slinging for me.

116
00:09:58,716 --> 00:10:00,684
I need you to write an article.

117
00:10:00,751 --> 00:10:03,049
-What about?
-I ain't no killer.

118
00:10:03,387 --> 00:10:05,412
The only thing I am is hard up.

119
00:10:05,489 --> 00:10:07,923
If you're not the killer, then who is?

120
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:11,951
If I told you what's going on
you'd think I had a kink in my Slinky.

121
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,395
Tomorrow,
they're having their first planting...

122
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,865
at the Grateful Homeless Cemetery.

123
00:10:16,934 --> 00:10:19,061
-Cemetery?
-Go there.

124
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,367
Hang out till sunset.

125
00:10:21,672 --> 00:10:22,866
You'll see.

126
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,807
Do it and I'll spill the rest
like a fucking floodgate.

127
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,140
I'll even throw in a few names.

128
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:29,941
-Names?
-Yeah.

129
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:33,609
City officials
with their mitts in the Grateful Homeless.

130
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:36,209
Meet me tomorrow night, 25th and Tivoli.

131
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:37,379
Okay.

132
00:10:39,156 --> 00:10:40,646
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

133
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,553
Why me?

134
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:45,652
Because you look hungrier than I do.

135
00:11:08,652 --> 00:11:13,146
""A time to keep and a time to cast away,
a time to rend and a time to sew.

136
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,092
""A time to keep silence
and a time to speak.

137
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,362
""The Lord giveth,
and the Lord taketh away.""

138
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,956
Yeah.
Sometimes he forgets that first part.

139
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,524
That's a pretty jaded view of life.

140
00:11:26,437 --> 00:11:28,632
Well, maybe coming from you. I mean...

141
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,799
the Lord giveth you plenty.

142
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,305
You've taken quite an interest
in this place.

143
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:35,572
I'm just following up a story.

144
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,637
Looking for anything out of the ordinary.

145
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,706
There's nothing here but the dead.

146
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:41,649
Why not let them rest in peace?

147
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,687
-And dignity.
-That, too.

148
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,752
Hey, look, I hope
I didn't rattle you too much the other day.

149
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,418
It takes a lot more than that to rattle me.

150
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:53,486
Oh, well, I would give anything
to find out just what that could be.

151
00:11:53,564 --> 00:11:56,158
Well, stick around. You're working up to it.

152
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,899
I was kind of hoping to buy you lunch.

153
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:03,032
Now, why would I want
to have lunch with you?

154
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:05,166
Because I'm far more interesting...

155
00:12:05,242 --> 00:12:07,540
than whatever Gumby
you might be seeing right now.

156
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:10,205
And, you also might be interested
to see the story...

157
00:12:10,281 --> 00:12:13,444
that I'm writing
on that little society of yours.

158
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:15,743
What do you say?

159
00:12:17,221 --> 00:12:18,518
I love telling stories.

160
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,021
You know,
I was thinking more along the lines...

161
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:31,590
of a nice, quiet restaurant.

162
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,661
This is quiet.

163
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:39,275
And you don't have to leave a tip.

164
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,441
At least, not money.

165
00:12:43,514 --> 00:12:46,415
So, I thought
you were gonna tell me a story.

166
00:12:46,484 --> 00:12:49,282
Well, actually,
I thought it would be better...

167
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,148
if we waited until we finished eating.

168
00:12:52,957 --> 00:12:54,356
Why is that?

169
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,788
I lied.

170
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:00,991
It was just a routine notice.

171
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,396
I needed the company.

172
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:06,396
You're not gonna storm out of here?

173
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,995
You've already killed my afternoon.

174
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:12,538
Besides, it never hurts
to improve press relations.

175
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:14,909
You know...

176
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:17,678
the Grateful Homeless Society...

177
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:21,047
is very fortunate
to have you for its spokesperson.

178
00:13:22,152 --> 00:13:24,586
Are we working up to a compliment?

179
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:29,020
No, it's just that most spokespersons
don't have a sense of humor...

180
00:13:29,093 --> 00:13:31,459
nor do they look like you.

181
00:13:32,997 --> 00:13:34,624
Now I am rattled.

182
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:38,760
Sure you don't want a bite?

183
00:13:39,036 --> 00:13:40,697
I don't eat meat.

184
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,638
Oh, God. You're not one of those, are you?

185
00:13:43,941 --> 00:13:45,340
Not exactly.

186
00:13:58,656 --> 00:14:00,783
You look good enough to eat.

187
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,629
I have never met anybody like you before.

188
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,089
You wear me out.

189
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,795
Do you really want to see me again?

190
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:15,304
Oh, yes. I really would like that.

191
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:18,538
You know, I'm not the type of guy who...

192
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,670
believes in love at first sight,
but I think I'm about to convert.

193
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:27,774
You're the type of girl
that I could spend a lifetime with.

194
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:40,195
Hey, let me ask you something.

195
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,622
Off the record.

196
00:14:45,703 --> 00:14:49,139
What do you think about
the Grateful Homeless Society?

197
00:14:50,908 --> 00:14:52,239
Who cares?

198
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,509
-Off the record?
-Yeah. Wait--

199
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,490
Is this your own private press conference?

200
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,389
Is that what this is?

201
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,857
Okay, just go easy with that, will you?

202
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:16,456
Well, I've just declared a news blackout.

203
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:19,024
Look, you know, I'm only doing my job.

204
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:21,605
You don't want to see me do mine.

205
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:25,335
So, I'm the kind of girl
that you could spend a lifetime with?

206
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,072
I lied.
I was just pumping you for information.

207
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:35,141
What the hell.

208
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,080
More where that came from.

209
00:15:44,662 --> 00:15:46,152
Jesus Christ.

210
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,266
Roebuck?

211
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,898
Did you go? Did you see?

212
00:16:27,037 --> 00:16:28,834
All I saw was graves.

213
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,601
Who the hell did this to you?

214
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:35,309
You fucking dickhead.
You didn't stay long enough.

215
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:41,612
You're gonna tell me your story.

216
00:16:41,685 --> 00:16:44,313
You're gonna tell me what you know.

217
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:48,114
Names. You were gonna give me names!

218
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,196
I need that fucking story,
you fucking bum!

219
00:16:53,731 --> 00:16:55,665
Don't die on me!

220
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,361
Don't fucking die!

221
00:17:10,047 --> 00:17:12,709
Oh, come on, you son of a bitch!

222
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,396
Fucking bum.

223
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,809
I need help.

224
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,681
Help?

225
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,945
Mr. Sweeney, you need burial.

226
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,248
I need an assignment, Tillman.

227
00:18:24,321 --> 00:18:26,050
You must be joking.

228
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:27,548
I'm gonna have to hire somebody...

229
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:30,320
to come in and clean up the mess
you made just walking in here.

230
00:18:30,427 --> 00:18:32,588
-You wanted to see me, Chief?
-Wait a minute. Wait.

231
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,230
You gave my job to this lowlife?

232
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:38,598
Yeah. I thought it was about time
I had a writer doing it.

233
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:41,035
I want you to head out
to the Grateful Homeless Cemetery.

234
00:18:41,104 --> 00:18:43,334
-They're burying that homeless killer.
-Today?

235
00:18:43,407 --> 00:18:46,604
That's right.
You better hurry if you want a spot.

236
00:18:46,977 --> 00:18:50,140
Now, look.
I don't want to have to call security.

237
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:53,482
What am I saying? I'd love to call security.

238
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,778
Norma, get security up here.

239
00:19:00,824 --> 00:19:03,452
Never mind, Norma. Just call a janitor.

240
00:19:06,763 --> 00:19:09,596
And so, we commit this soul to eternity.

241
00:20:00,717 --> 00:20:02,241
Son of a bitch.

242
00:21:00,177 --> 00:21:02,145
Crazy bastard was right.

243
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,355
Let me out of here!

244
00:22:58,428 --> 00:23:01,488
You fucks, let me the fuck out of here!

245
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:05,391
Let me out! You fucks!

246
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,996
Good evening, Mr. Sweeney.

247
00:23:45,642 --> 00:23:48,076
Nice of you to drop by for dinner.

248
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,973
Who the hell are you people?

249
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:54,378
Well, that depends.

250
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:58,117
Until recently, we were known as...

251
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,179
the infamous Homeless Killer.

252
00:24:01,057 --> 00:24:03,821
But now, you may refer to us as...

253
00:24:03,894 --> 00:24:07,330
the Grateful Homeless Outcasts and
Unwanteds Layaway Society.

254
00:24:11,468 --> 00:24:12,662
Ghouls?

255
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,271
It's been so long
since we've had fresh meat.

256
00:24:22,913 --> 00:24:23,937
No!

257
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:30,820
Oh, God. Climsky!

258
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:34,482
Don't mind me, Sweeney.
I just stopped in for a scoop.

259
00:24:38,695 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm not really hungry.

260
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,154
I'll just pick.

261
00:25:06,856 --> 00:25:07,948
Jess.

262
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:13,229
I know. I said I don't eat meat.

263
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:16,432
-I lied.
-Help me.

264
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:26,140
If you don't mind,
I think I'll just help myself.

265
00:25:29,312 --> 00:25:31,803
I knew you'd be good enough to eat.

266
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:48,620
Pretty tasteless, wouldn't you say?

267
00:25:48,732 --> 00:25:51,326
I guess, in the end, Mr. Sweeney learned...

268
00:25:51,401 --> 00:25:54,598
not to go digging
into other people's business.

269
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:58,732
Although, you'll be happy to hear,
he's found himself a new career.

270
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,469
As a ghost writer.

271
00:26:02,612 --> 00:26:05,479
So, still hungry for dessert?

272
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:08,544
I hope you like Cannibal's Soup.

273
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:10,882
It's M'm! M'm! Good!

274
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:47,378
English
