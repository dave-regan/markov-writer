1
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,514
Damn!

2
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,349
Whiskey, let's find us
a nice little bank.

3
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,230
What do you know? I'm the boss.

4
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,155
That does it, Whiskey.

5
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,955
Now just for that, I'm going in alone.

6
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,151
Without me, you'll wind up
holding a broken chair together.

7
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,351
You say something?

8
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,593
Okay...

9
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,957
...but remember, I'm boss.

10
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,398
Cactus Jack Slade waits in the shade

11
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,837
Pondering his evil schemes

12
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,910
He's a well-known bad guy

13
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,797
Ready to try whatever it takes
To live up to his name

14
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,749
No one is safe from the villain

15
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,155
He totes a dangerous gun

16
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,196
And robbing and stealing
And just plain dirty dealing

17
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,955
Cactus Jack Slade gets it done

18
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,549
Get off the streets, he's the villain

19
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,756
Meet me in front.

20
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,478
Close all the stores
Lock all the doors

21
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,952
Cactus Jack Slade has arrived

22
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,988
- Who is it?
- The sheriff.

23
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,958
Open up.

24
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,399
You're not the sheriff.

25
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,756
I lied.

26
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,557
One, close the door. Two, open the
safe. Three, on the floor.

27
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,358
You forgot number two.

28
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,157
Oh, no, I didn't. I did that
when you stuck that gun in my face.

29
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,196
- Open that safe.
- The safe is locked for the night.

30
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,399
And only Mr. Simpson
has the combination.

31
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,914
I'm just a clerk.

32
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,552
Excuse me.

33
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,754
Got a light?

34
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,560
How about a cigar?

35
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,751
I don't smoke.

36
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,271
Oh, I should've had two...

37
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:03,354
- What's that noise?
- It came from the bank.

38
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,949
The sheriff's coming.

39
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,559
What are you doing, you traitor?
Whiskey? You traitor!

40
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,711
I'll get even with you.

41
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,275
You won't get away with this.

42
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,789
Traitor! I'll get even with you.

43
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,192
Get your hands off me.
Nobody pushes me around like this.

44
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,349
Here, ma'am, let me help you
cross the street.

45
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,669
Are you blind?
Don't you see all these horses?

46
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,754
We'll never live through this.
Watch out!

47
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,520
Are you trying to get me killed?
Oh, this is terrible.

48
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,959
Here, let me help you, ma'am.

49
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,149
See, Mother, safe and sound.

50
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,749
First of all, I ain't your mother.

51
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,270
Secondly,
take your arm off me, dummy!

52
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,355
And third, I didn't want to cross
the street in the first place.

53
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,551
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,151
Charming, you're gonna miss
your train.

55
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,396
Now remember what I told you.

56
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,475
Avery Simpson would steal the candy
from a young'un if he got the chance.

57
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,756
- Are you listening?
- Yes, Papa.

58
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,793
- Them shoes still on that mare?
- Hell, yes.

59
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,989
There's enough silver in that hill
to make a St. Louis hooker happy...

60
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,596
...but it won't do no good
in the hills, understand?

61
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,793
So you watch out
for that thieving Avery Simpson...

62
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,953
...or he'll wind up owning
all of my mine. You follow me?

63
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,395
One ticket to Snake's End.

64
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,998
That'll do it,
one ticket to Snake's End.

65
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,949
Going away on a business trip,
Mr. Parody?

66
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,754
None of your business, Charming.

67
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,158
Well, here's your ticket.
Well, take it. Bite on it.

68
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,239
I'll get ahold of somebody to meet you
in Snake's End.

69
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,000
And he'll protect you.

70
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,989
I can take care of myself.

71
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,115
Charming, I'm not worried about...
I'm worried about the money!

72
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,073
Bring the money right back
to the house.

73
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:08,553
- And be careful of strangers.
- Yes, Daddy.

74
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,756
Pardon me, sir.

75
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,310
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- So?

76
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,473
That's my name.
You have a telegram for me.

77
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,356
Boy, you talk...

78
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,755
...funny.

79
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,959
Well, that's easy for you to say.
What about my telegram?

80
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,349
So I did. I forgot to write it down.

81
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,956
With all that commotion
and everything...

82
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,754
...going over at the bank...

83
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,396
But I do recollect what it said.

84
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,200
It was from a guy named...

85
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,194
...Parody Jones. He said...

86
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,355
...his daughter was coming into town
to pick something up at the bank.

87
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,757
And that you are supposed
to escort her...

88
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,356
...back out to his...

89
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,758
...place.

90
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,869
And then he said something
about you owing him.

91
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,156
That's true.

92
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,956
He saved my life once.
I've been beholden to him ever since.

93
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,960
When is Miss Jones arriving?

94
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,159
Miss Jones is...

95
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,955
Miss Jones is coming in
On the evening train

96
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,151
Do I still have time to eat?

97
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:41,474
Sure, you do. Just go on over
to the Broken Spoke and eat.

98
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,471
Broken Spoke? It's a saloon.

99
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,036
That's right.
And this here's a telegraph office.

100
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,516
To send a telegram, you come here.

101
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,830
It's the only place in town.

102
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,477
To eat, you go to the Broken Spoke,
because it's the only place in...

103
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,551
Thank you. Thank you.

104
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,239
...town.

105
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,951
Oh, I don't believe it.
Oh, easy. Go slow, go slow.

106
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,789
What happened?

107
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,158
She was trying to cross the street.
Got hit by a beer wagon.

108
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,150
I always say that alcohol and driving
don't mix. What a pity.

109
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,959
I thought I heard that voice!

110
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,517
Get out! I'll kill you!
Stop this stretcher! Get that man!

111
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,271
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't
have been hurt. Turn around!

112
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,398
Turn this stretcher! Get that man!

113
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:44,158
I'll teach you when I want to cross
the street!

114
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,559
You leave me alone!
I'm gonna make you...

115
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,031
- Morning, Mr. Avery.
- I want to see your prisoner.

116
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,156
I want to see him alone.

117
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,958
Traitor.

118
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,352
- Cactus Jack?
- Who are you?

119
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,755
I'm Avery Simpson.

120
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,557
I own the bank you blew up last night.

121
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,312
I used too much dynamite.

122
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,950
Well, I'm not mad at you
for blowing up my bank.

123
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,795
I'm not even mad at you for trying
to blow my safe apart.

124
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,635
I don't keep any money in it anyway.
I don't trust banks.

125
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:45,157
- You know why I'm not mad at you?
- Why?

126
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,950
Because you and me may be able
to do business together.

127
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,555
Now if we can...

128
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,752
...you'll walk out of here with me
scot-free.

129
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,758
And I'll give you $1000 cash tomorrow.

130
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,873
If we can't do business together,
the sheriff is gonna hang you...

131
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,758
...tonight.

132
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,550
I don't know.

133
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,951
- Well?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.

134
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,030
- It's a deal.
- Good.

135
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,750
A year ago I grubstaked
an old prospector.

136
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,350
For that I got half of everything.
You follow me?

137
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,519
Now he needs more money
to work the mine.

138
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,558
He's putting up the other half
as collateral.

139
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,792
I'm gonna lend him that money.
You follow me?

140
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,994
His daughter will take the cash back
in the morning.

141
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,678
I don't want it to get there.
If it don't, I'll get the whole mine.

142
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,516
- You still follow me?
- What about a little advance?

143
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:16,955
Here's $20, which
I'll deduct from the 500 you'll earn.

144
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,869
You made mention of $1000,
didn't you?

145
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,755
I thought I made mention of a hanging,
didn't I?

146
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,552
Five hundred dollars.

147
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,349
Whiskey, if you behave,
we're gonna be rich. Real rich.

148
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,551
Whiskey.

149
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,353
Not you. Stay outside.

150
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,357
Leave the bottle.

151
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,550
That's an uppercut.

152
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,754
That's a left cross.

153
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,554
And that's a two-by-four.

154
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,989
Thank you.

155
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,556
Mr. Stranger...

156
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,558
...the evening train's coming.
I just heard the...

157
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,556
...blow.
It's at Five-Mile Crossing.

158
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:12,072
Then the train has five miles to go.
I still can finish my meal.

159
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,553
If you want to meet the old train
you'd better come now because...

160
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,193
...Five-Mile Crossing is only
half a mile down the t...

161
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,749
- Track?
- Way.

162
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,552
Really?

163
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,751
I'd better go.

164
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,998
Charming
Charming

165
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,756
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

166
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,158
Charming
Charming

167
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:56,554
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

168
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,308
Pardon me. Pardon me.

169
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,350
Would you mind taking hold of these,
please?

170
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,352
Well, yes, ma'am.

171
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,156
Wonderful.

172
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,196
You were the only lady
to get off the train.

173
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,555
Yes, I was.

174
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,754
- Then you must be Charming.
- You've said it all.

175
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,276
I mean, Charming Jones.
Parody's daughter.

176
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,512
I'm your pa's friend.
He told me to pick you up.

177
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,553
- I'm Handsome Stranger.
- Yes, you are.

178
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,716
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

179
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,192
My!

180
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,353
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes. Yes.

181
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,997
Handsome Stranger is such
a wonderful nickname.

182
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,198
How did you get it?

183
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
It's not a nickname.
It's my real name.

184
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,590
- Really?
- Yes, I was named after my father.

185
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,149
He must have been quite a man.

186
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,557
I don't know. I never met him.

187
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,799
How did you meet my daddy?
I never heard him mention your name.

188
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,679
I met him in Denver.
He saved my life.

189
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,719
He nursed me
after I got beat up by ruffians.

190
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,751
Oh, dear. Why did they do that?

191
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,192
You know, I don't know.

192
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,228
But like I said,
it was a few years ago in Denver.

193
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,157
I saw a bunch of crazy horses
running down Main Street.

194
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,552
I finally realized
that these were runaways.

195
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,231
So I jumped on my horse
and I chased them down the street.

196
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,876
I ran after them.
It was crazy.

197
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,551
They were going faster and faster.
I was catching up with them.

198
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,396
There were children and women
and old men in danger in the street.

199
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,599
It was really dangerous.
I tried to save them.

200
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,957
You risked your life to try
to stop them.

201
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,199
- I do this every day. I try to...
- Oh, how wonderful.

202
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,399
So I kept running after them
and finally I did catch up.

203
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,991
- What are you doing?
- I got them under control.

204
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,834
Get him off my horse.

205
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,157
You dummy. How am I gonna
make a living?

206
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,875
That was the only cathouse in town.

207
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,794
Excuse me, ma'am.
What do you do for a living?

208
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,954
And that's the way it was.

209
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,272
That was a brave and noble thing
you did, stopping that team of horses.

210
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,751
Why, you could have been killed!

211
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,156
Oh, yes.

212
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,952
There's been a change of plans.

213
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,838
The girl already got somebody
to ride shotgun for her.

214
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,716
He don't look like much, but
it won't be easy to get the money.

215
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,838
Why don't I just hold them up...?

216
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,753
Why don't you just do that,
if you think you can handle it?

217
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,388
What makes you think I can't?

218
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,189
You did such a magnificent job
on the bank.

219
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,918
Yeah, well, I've had a lot more
experience robbing people.

220
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,475
Make sure you get that money.

221
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,952
- I'll get it.
- Make sure you bring back all of it.

222
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,790
- I'm not dishonest.
- And I'm not a trusting man.

223
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,560
I always insure a risk.

224
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,356
You take good care of that box,
young man.

225
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,797
Charming, have a nice trip.
Say hi to your dad.

226
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,352
We could've saved
some of Daddy's money...

227
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,477
...by taking only one room.

228
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,280
Oh, no, don't worry about it.

229
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,760
I can pay for my own room.

230
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:18,997
He was waiting at the station
When the train pulled in

231
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,473
He was there to meet a lady
As a favour for a friend

232
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,470
The stranger was a proud man
Who paid the debts he owed

233
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,152
And it was his time to pay the debt
He owed from long ago

234
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,231
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

235
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,757
No one seems to know
Your business here

236
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,555
With your steel-blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

237
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,475
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

238
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,072
Handsome Stranger
Where do you come from?

239
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,637
No one seems to know
Your business here

240
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,554
With your steel-blue eyes
And pearl handled guns

241
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,310
There ain't an outlaw anywhere
You fear

242
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,351
Oh, let me straighten out the bags.
Can you hold this?

243
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,280
- Are you gonna be long?
- No.

244
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,711
- What are you doing?
- Tying down the bags.

245
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,793
Higher.

246
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,072
No.
I mean me, higher.

247
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,113
Now, was that difficult?

248
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,430
This is the day we strike it rich.

249
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,796
One, I merely step out
in front of that wagon.

250
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,599
That ought to stop them.
Two, I shoot the boyfriend.

251
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,034
Three, I steal the money
and ravish that woman.

252
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,916
Leaving that oily banker
with his thumb up his dumb.

253
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,316
I'll handle this.

254
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,156
- Did you hear that?
- No, I heard nothing.

255
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,874
There was a big sound.

256
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,155
Whiskey!

257
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,669
Whiskey, where you been?

258
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,034
Why does the banker want him watched?
He needs to be looked after.

259
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,072
- I've never done this before.
- You're doing a good job.

260
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,554
Oh, thank you.

261
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,834
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, you're so welcome.

262
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,673
- What a relief!
- What?

263
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,718
We passed the bend and
nothing happened.

264
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,678
Yes, I know.

265
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,832
Whiskey!

266
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:34,478
- It sure is desolate out here.
- Yes, ma'am.

267
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,999
Won't it be awful if we're robbed
or attacked by bandits?

268
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,870
I hear they do
terrible things to women.

269
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,150
You don't talk much, do you?

270
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:14,870
I wish you'd make some conversation.

271
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:21,036
Otherwise, it's going to be a very,
very dull trip.

272
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,672
- What do you want to talk about?
- Oh, anything. Surprise me.

273
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,874
You want to see my gun?
Bet you've never seen one like this.

274
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,871
It's like any other gun.

275
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,874
It just looks like any other gun,
but it's different.

276
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,798
Oh, really?

277
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,153
Well, tell me.
I'm dying to know.

278
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,915
- This is a seven-shot six-shooter.
- Yeah?

279
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,998
And I had it specially made.

280
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,793
Why?

281
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,958
- Why?
- Yes, why?

282
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,798
I don't know.

283
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,592
- Nobody asked me that before.
- I'll bet.

284
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,029
Ah, I love those Latin hymns.

285
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:02,397
Welcome, stranger.
You're a handsome stranger.

286
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,238
I see by the guns you wear
that you're a man of violence.

287
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,680
Violence is ignorance.
But it's not too late to be saved.

288
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,714
The skies are darkening.
Soon, the rain will fall.

289
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,115
The angels are weeping.

290
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:23,949
Let their teardrops
cleanse your heart.

291
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,754
- It's not too late to be saved.
- Really?

292
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,590
You can be the salt of the earth,
the light of the life.

293
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,718
- But you gotta stop drinking.
- I'm not.

294
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,270
- No drinking.
- Never.

295
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,158
- No cussing.
- Never.

296
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,949
No dirty jokes.

297
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,639
The wicked sprung up like grass and
the works of iniquity flourished...

298
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,630
...it was so they might be destroyed.
Hand me your guns.

299
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,711
Now, if I were a mind to rob you...

300
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,237
...or perhaps
molest your lady friend...

301
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,479
...this gun wouldn't scare you at all.

302
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,878
Because we both know it's not loaded.

303
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,633
- But I want to tell you that...
- Freeze. My gun is definitely loaded.

304
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,273
Right.

305
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,591
If I were to pull the trigger...

306
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,439
...it wouldn't scare you.
- Reverend!

307
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,318
I wish he wouldn't have left so soon.

308
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,557
I think he really could've helped me.

309
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,593
Me too.

310
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,910
You and your seven-shot six-shooter.

311
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,193
Whiskey.

312
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,679
What happened?

313
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,911
Behave yourself.

314
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:52,273
Whiskey, when we steal that money,
we're gonna buy a nice spread.

315
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,880
With a little corral
and a couple of cute fillies for you.

316
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,717
I think I'll get me
a couple cute fillies too.

317
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:09,197
Now, go away.
I gotta work this out.

318
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,958
Yeah, this is gonna work.

319
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,595
I like this place.
Let's spend the night here.

320
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:41,637
Perfect.

321
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,638
I'll take care of the team, okay?

322
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:10,432
Charming
Charming

323
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,515
There ain't no woman in these parts
That looks as good as you

324
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,759
Charming
Charming

325
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,118
Don't forget
What you were sent to do

326
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,429
She came to town
With her head held high

327
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,151
Cowboys smile when she walks by

328
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:41,076
Across the badlands she does ride

329
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:46,756
With a handsome stranger
By her side

330
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,237
Charming

331
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,996
Charming

332
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,830
There ain't no woman
Looks as good as you

333
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,118
What's the matter?

334
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,628
- Do you know which way is north?
- Why?

335
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:25,393
When we stay overnight here,
we point the wagon to the North Star.

336
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,078
- We know in the morning where to go.
- Really?

337
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,392
I read it in one of the
pioneer magazines.

338
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,759
Tell you what.

339
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,590
If we cross the river and stay on
the road we've been on all day...

340
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,678
...we'll get to where we're going.

341
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:51,308
- You're right.
- You know, I think I'll take a bath.

342
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,909
I'll get some wood for the fire.

343
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,675
Would you like to scrub my back?

344
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,235
I'd better get the wood.

345
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,275
I knew he'd say that.
I knew it.

346
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,991
Handsome?

347
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,196
Handsome, is that you?

348
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:26,270
We should have packed a lunch.
It's gonna be a long job.

349
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,072
You wanna Indian wrestle?

350
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,876
Miss Charming?

351
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,873
I've been lying here
and looking at you...

352
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,838
...and thinking how fitting
your name is.

353
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,879
I mean, it really does you justice.

354
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,913
How did you get a name like that?

355
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,952
It was the first thing
that my daddy said...

356
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:13,192
...when he found out
they were going to have me.

357
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,479
Mama said,
"Parody, I think I'm pregnant."

358
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,470
And Daddy said,
"Oh, charming. Just charming."

359
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:26,950
Your dad.
He's quite a guy, I'll tell you.

360
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,637
Do you have a girl?

361
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,993
Have you ever had a girl?

362
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,432
I don't think so, Miss Charming.

363
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,076
What are you gonna do?

364
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:08,072
It's going to get cold tonight.

365
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,114
So I think I'm getting
some wood for the fire.

366
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,633
What the...?

367
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,791
Respect!

368
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,875
One of these days,
I'm gonna trade you in for a mule.

369
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,749
Yeah, you think you're so
goldarned smart.

370
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,634
I don't think that was so funny.

371
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,714
Whiskey!

372
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,148
Did you hear me?

373
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,472
Then what are you standing there for?

374
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:39,999
Anxious Beaver, look down there.

375
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,239
Over there.

376
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,871
- It's him.
- Him it is.

377
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,669
That's a very smart horse.

378
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,391
Now, that's a horse for you, Mary.

379
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,152
My braves!

380
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,072
We're gonna have a necktie party,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

381
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,314
You're gonna be the guest of honour,
Mr. Handsome Stranger.

382
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,033
Whiskey!

383
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,630
Whiskey!

384
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,355
I'll tell you when.

385
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,559
Missed.

386
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,311
Rock went behind. Gonna hit the thing.
I don't get that.

387
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:06,156
It's chapter six.
"The tunnel in the hillside."

388
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,149
Right there.

389
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,949
Did you see that?

390
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,554
Oh, what do you know?

391
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,354
This is a shortcut.

392
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,949
Watch this.

393
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:32,355
I'll show you how to handle
these situations.

394
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,956
Here.

395
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,756
Back up.

396
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:53,360
Keep it that way.

397
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,349
Keep it taut.

398
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,474
Back up!

399
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,312
Back up!

400
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,953
Do you hear me?

401
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,756
We've got to be careful from here on.
This is Indian country.

402
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:40,957
- Indian County.
- County?

403
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:56,360
Whiskey, this book has been
fouling me up.

404
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:01,195
I don't need Jesse James.

405
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,159
Or Doc Holliday.

406
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,954
Or Billy the Kid.

407
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,750
I don't need anybody.

408
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:14,556
From now on, I do it my way.

409
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,755
Cactus Jack Slade.

410
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,195
Why does old enemy...

411
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:18,831
...Prickly Jack come to Nervous Elk?

412
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:23,552
It's Cactus Jack. Cactus Jack Slade.

413
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,192
I come to speak with straight tongue.

414
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:32,149
Tongue may be straight...

415
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,757
...but mouth hide many sharp teeth.

416
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,154
I seek great chief's help.
I lost my heart to a girl.

417
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,359
- Can't you talk without your hands?
- Yeah, well...

418
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,951
...this fellow that's with her
is one big mean critter.

419
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:57,156
How can this tired old warrior help?

420
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,397
I was hoping that if you and me
and a bunch of these braves...

421
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,393
...were to pop out
sudden-like at him...

422
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,349
...he wouldn't be so likely
to start a ruckus.

423
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,188
You want nothing from this man...

424
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,590
...but woman?
- Not one thing.

425
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,156
Well, I'd take the buckboard.

426
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:24,756
She couldn't ride a horse
dressed like she is.

427
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,554
I'd even give him my horse.

428
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,960
I'm still willing
to do him a kindness.

429
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,148
Giving him that horse no kindness.

430
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,554
What's in it for Nervous Elk?

431
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:56,354
- Scalps.
- Scalps?

432
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:02,556
- Come now, Many-Sticker John.
- It's Cactus Jack Slade.

433
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,558
Whatever.

434
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:11,193
Scalps don't put beans on table.

435
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,550
I'll share the woman.

436
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,558
White woman crazy.

437
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,797
They all keep one bullet in gun.

438
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,792
Yeah, I heard that.

439
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,396
By the way, I've been meaning
to ask you...

440
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,760
What do you Indians do when
you capture a white woman?

441
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,356
Nervous Elk not know.

442
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:50,789
Crazy white woman always shoots self
before me have chance to find out!

443
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:55,352
All except one.

444
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,397
Who, by mistake...

445
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,189
...shoot Nervous Elk...

446
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,034
...in the jewels.

447
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,754
Yeah, I remember.

448
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,350
For old-time's sake, will you help me?

449
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:16,152
Me like nearsighted elk
that make love to cactus...

450
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,954
...been stuck before.

451
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,595
We will help.

452
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:26,116
I knew I could count on my friend.
Thanks, chief.

453
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,359
Now what's the matter with you?

454
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,439
What's wrong?

455
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,750
I wasn't gonna give you away.

456
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,394
Come here. I was just saying that.

457
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,154
See you at the camp.

458
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,955
That man is here to steal money,
isn't he?

459
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,153
And if you help him,
you'll be stealing also.

460
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,959
But you've given your word
to the banker.

461
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,875
- Would you go back on it now?
- Uh-huh.

462
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:40,639
- What about that white man?
- Piss on the white man.

463
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:13,398
Listen to those drums!
It's so scary.

464
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,950
Don't worry. They never attack
until daylight.

465
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,151
Really?

466
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,037
Thank you.

467
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:42,189
Know what? He's gonna
set the Indian back 50 years.

468
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:47,753
I don't know which is worse,
him or those damn drums.

469
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,758
This is the plan of attack.
Go over it with your troops.

470
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,958
- Okay, chief.
- Good brave.

471
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,996
Well, Handsome...

472
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,995
...this is our last night together.
- Yeah.

473
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:10,360
Tomorrow at this time you'll be home
safe and sound with your daddy.

474
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,755
- I'm not really sleepy, are you?
- Oh, no, I'm wide awake.

475
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,758
Good.

476
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:25,154
What have you got in mind?

477
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:30,912
- I know what.
- What?

478
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:35,710
- Want to hear some knock-knock jokes?
- I'll get some wood for the fire.

479
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:39,591
We attack at dawn.

480
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,992
Chief, why don't we attack now,
when they're off guard?

481
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:47,994
- Indians never attack till dawn.
- I know, but why?

482
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,156
Because at night, Indians too busy
pounding on those dumb drums!

483
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,956
There they are!

484
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,353
- What are we waiting for?
- It not dawn yet.

485
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:34,435
Until 6:28 and 45 seconds,
according to almanac.

486
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,837
Chief, you sure your braves
can handle this?

487
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:43,155
My people greatest light cavalry
ever mount horse!

488
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:46,552
- I hope so.
- It dawn!

489
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:52,198
My braves, prepare to mount!

490
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:57,355
Prepare to mount!

491
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,232
Mount!

492
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:04,791
Mount!

493
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:08,994
Charge!

494
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,593
- Chief!
- Set up field hospital!

495
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,834
Count casualties!
Prepare for another attack!

496
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,595
- Prepare for attack!
- Will you shut up?

497
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:55,392
Chief, I appreciate your help, but...

498
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:59,952
...it's not gonna work out.
- My word is bond!

499
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,596
Hey, Beaver, any braves still moving?

500
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,957
- Yeah, chief, two.
- Good. Get mounted!

501
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:11,950
- Get mounted!
- Four of us will continue.

502
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:18,349
No fear, Porcupine Jack.
You're in good hands.

503
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,754
No, it's Cactus Jack.
Cactus Jack Slade!

504
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,758
Jeez, I'm gonna do it my own way.

505
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,150
Whiskey!

506
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:34,719
- Did anybody see my horse?
- He went thataway.

507
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:37,549
Whiskey!

508
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:45,554
Whiskey!

509
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:50,792
Thattaboy, Handsome!

510
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,429
Son of a gun!

511
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,200
They're gaining on us. Come on!

512
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,474
Keep them between the ditches!

513
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:32,118
Yeah, you tell them! Come on, Bumper!

514
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,994
You're looking good! Come on, honey!

515
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,396
- They're getting closer, Handsome.
- I know.

516
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,558
I don't know what got them so mad.

517
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,349
Well, I'll tell you, I don't know.
It could be...

518
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,398
...those knock-knock jokes.
I don't know.

519
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,438
- Really?
- Really.

520
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,273
But I do know we're slowing down.

521
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:05,194
I think you better go a little
faster, because they're gonna get us.

522
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:09,558
I can't go any faster.
These horses are really tired.

523
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,958
Well, in a little ways
you're gonna be safe.

524
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,112
- What do you mean, ma'am?
- Trust me.

525
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:22,959
There it is.

526
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:44,835
You, back over here...

527
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,355
...where you belong.

528
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:55,359
- That was pretty close, chief.
- Close not good enough.

529
01:11:55,560 --> 01:12:00,918
Well, braves, back to bead-stringing.

530
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,799
Bye-bye, chief. Maybe next time!

531
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:14,756
And I got all dressed up for nothing.

532
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,754
On tiptoe.

533
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:43,156
Stop.

534
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,353
Whiskey?

535
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,556
Whiskey?

536
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,956
Whiskey!

537
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,158
Excuse me, ma'am?

538
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,797
Isn't it dangerous to have
blasting powder in the house?

539
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,916
I really don't care.

540
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,550
We got 'em.

541
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:51,273
I don't need your help.

542
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:06,269
Whiskey, you've got
a funny sense of humour.

543
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:15,960
What did you do in there?

544
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:23,349
Take another step,
and I'll ventilate you.

545
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:30,750
Nobody outsmarts Cactus Jack Slade.

546
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,156
Hold it.

547
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:40,758
Like the man said, just hold it.

548
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:55,679
Exactly what are your intentions?

549
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,070
To see that justice is done.

550
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:02,996
And yours?

551
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:04,798
Blow his head off.

552
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:08,350
- Steal the money.
- And?

553
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:14,195
Then I'm gonna ravish you.

554
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:20,113
Handsome, you lose.

555
01:21:21,240 --> 01:21:25,791
What's his name here just outbid you.

556
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,989
