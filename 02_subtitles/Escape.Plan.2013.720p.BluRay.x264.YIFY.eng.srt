1
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:28,048
- Yo, are you up? - Yeah.

2
00:01:28,674 --> 00:01:30,300
Jax has got the jump on you tomorrow.

3
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,844
Two bell.

4
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:36,640
I figure I owe you.

5
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:42,312
Yo. Did you hear what I said?

6
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:45,190
I heard.

7
00:01:50,112 --> 00:01:51,905
Thanks.

8
00:02:12,134 --> 00:02:13,963
Everybody down now!

9
00:02:14,587 --> 00:02:15,595
On the ground!

10
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,598
You! Inmate! On the ground!

11
00:02:19,975 --> 00:02:21,268
Down!

12
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:24,563
- Get down! - You heard him!

13
00:02:24,646 --> 00:02:26,773
On the fucking ground!

14
00:02:51,882 --> 00:02:53,091
You're up.

15
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,095
To your left.

16
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,558
On the line.

17
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:10,567
All right...

18
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:12,736
Step to the right.

19
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,416
Let's go.

20
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:35,509
Hands.

21
00:03:40,847 --> 00:03:42,015
Enjoy'!

22
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:50,417
Against the wall.

23
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,338
Let's go.

24
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:34,169
Lunchtime, inmate. Eat your veggies.

25
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,346
There you go.

26
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:47,766
Hey, Roag!

27
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:49,601
Yeah?

28
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:50,977
Got the time?

29
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:53,146
Fuck you care? You got a date?

30
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,314
No.

31
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,275
Maybe you got a sister or a cousin?

32
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,654
Wanna get your head smashed?

33
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:02,072
No, not really.

34
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:05,325
It's five to 4:00.

35
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,745
Wise ass.

36
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,461
Hey, Fruitcake! Let's go.

37
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,842
Two... Three... Four...

38
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:27,389
Five... Six... Seven...

39
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,266
Eight...

40
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,601
Nine...

41
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:33,561
Ten...

42
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:40,742
290...

43
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,696
291...

44
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,369
292...

45
00:06:44,954 --> 00:06:46,283
293...

46
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:48,952
294...

47
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:51,052
295...

48
00:06:51,107 --> 00:06:52,455
296...

49
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,492
297...

50
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,792
298...

51
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:57,610
299...

52
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:59,045
300.

53
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:03,508
What the fuck...

54
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:06,970
Come on!

55
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,899
- You Okay? - I got everybody. I got everybody.

56
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,322
What the fuck's going on?

57
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:26,332
We've got a fire, gate two.

58
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,199
All prisoners back to their cells.

59
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,659
Copy that.

60
00:07:33,997 --> 00:07:35,582
What the fuck...

61
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:39,210
We got a runner! Repeat, prisoner is running!

62
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,841
Let's go, let's go!

63
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:04,861
Nice look.

64
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,112
Hush's idea.

65
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:08,031
Nice, right?

66
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:09,449
How was inside, boss man?

67
00:08:09,532 --> 00:08:10,400
Inside's great.

68
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:12,118
Everyone's asking about you.

69
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,423
If you weren't out soon,

70
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:16,706
I'd be breaking into that motherfucker and pulling your ass out.

71
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:19,918
Only ex-con I know gets out, wants to go back in.

72
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,796
I didn't say "wants." I said I would.

73
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,006
There is a difference.

74
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,030
Don't spend it all in one place.

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,753
We have an escape from Bendwater Penitentiary.

76
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,771
Step out of the booth with your hands in the air!

77
00:09:21,855 --> 00:09:23,398
Showtime.

78
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,278
Put your hands in the air! Now!

79
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,864
- Get them up, now! - Hands in the air!

80
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,936
Put your hands on your head! Interlock your fingers!

81
00:09:33,731 --> 00:09:35,535
Do not move!

82
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:38,580
Beautiful day.

83
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:06,191
What the hell is going on here?

84
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:07,635
Calm down, Warden.

85
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,110
I'm Lester Clark.

86
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:13,114
I'm the CEO of B&C Security.

87
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:16,117
You might have heard of us. No?

88
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:21,080
All right, well... We're an independent security company

89
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:24,751
hired by the Federal Bureau of Prisons

90
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:31,174
to test the integrity of their maximum security facilities nationwide.

91
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:35,995
This is Ray Breslin. He's my partner and...

92
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:38,264
resident Houdini.

93
00:10:38,932 --> 00:10:39,933
Warden.

94
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,145
For the last seven years, Ray has been inserted into

95
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:48,816
every maximum incarceration facility in the system.

96
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:52,070
He is there to ensure that each and every one of them

97
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:54,697
is 100% escape-proof.

98
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:58,231
And apparently yours wasn't,

99
00:10:58,388 --> 00:10:59,953
and he got out.

100
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,998
Okay, fine.

101
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:10,171
I suppose you're gonna tell me how you did it?

102
00:11:11,005 --> 00:11:13,216
Think he wants to know? Doesn't seem like it.

103
00:11:16,469 --> 00:11:18,805
Ray, you're on.

104
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:20,682
Warden, let's start from the top.

105
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:22,601
Any break requires three things,

106
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:23,810
knowing the layout,

107
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:25,500
understanding the routine,

108
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,188
and help from outside or in.

109
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:30,316
If you know the layout, the weak side is obvious.

110
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,653
In Bendwater's case, it's the Secure Housing Unit.

111
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,500
The government expenditure was 17 million dollars

112
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:37,824
building that facility.

113
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:39,909
It's state-of-the-art.

114
00:11:40,702 --> 00:11:42,020
The only problem is,

115
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:45,779
it's located next to an unsecured fire garage.

116
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:50,388
First I needed to get inside,

117
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,130
so I made some enemies.

118
00:11:55,383 --> 00:11:58,094
Once inside, it was obvious you were short-staffed.

119
00:11:58,177 --> 00:12:00,597
Federal guidelines recommend two guards are present

120
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,653
when transferring high risk inmates.

121
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:04,267
You only use one.

122
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:06,519
Knowing the guards' routine was the next step.

123
00:12:07,228 --> 00:12:08,732
Thirty seconds into my rec time,

124
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,107
my CO took a smoke break.

125
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:12,878
For seven minutes every day,

126
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,777
there were no eyes on me.

127
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,279
Two...

128
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:18,614
Three...

129
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:20,020
After I knew the routine,

130
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:21,784
all I had to do was pick the day

131
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:26,164
and arrange for a distraction at the front gate for exactly 4:00 p.m.

132
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,208
But at this point, you were still locked inside a steel box.

133
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,961
To get out, you had to have a key code.

134
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:34,464
You have very good chocolate milk.

135
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:40,637
See, the cartons contain a thin layer of wax laminate.

136
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,643
Lay it over the keypad,

137
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:50,647
the impression will indicate which four keys were pressed.

138
00:13:03,451 --> 00:13:04,184
With the four keys,

139
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,580
it's just a numbers game to identify the correct sequence.

140
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,665
I just needed to get to the keypad.

141
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:33,314
After I covered my tracks, I had one minute to make it

142
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,609
to the fire response shed before the team did.

143
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:48,437
I knew the guards were still on the roof

144
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:51,541
doing what they do, which is wasting time.

145
00:13:51,624 --> 00:13:52,834
What the fuck are you saying?

146
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,880
And before you know it, I'm right where I want to be.

147
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,476
Just in time to catch my ride.

148
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:22,822
Then your men drove me right off the grounds.

149
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,782
You have any questions?

150
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,577
Yeah. One.

151
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,100
What kind of man

152
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,168
would choose to spend most of his life in prison?

153
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,879
Don't take it personally, Warden.

154
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,675
Over the years, Ray has broken out of 14 of these institutions.

155
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:45,093
Some people have a talent to paint,

156
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:46,596
some to sing.

157
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:47,930
Me, I sing.

158
00:14:48,598 --> 00:14:51,809
Ray Breslin, he possesses a unique set of skills.

159
00:14:51,893 --> 00:14:55,438
He is able to break out of any prison designed by man.

160
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,858
So have you been good?

161
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,319
Yeah. You? You a good boy inside?

162
00:15:01,402 --> 00:15:02,820
Of course.

163
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,866
Okay... How did that thing with that guy go?

164
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:08,534
- What guy?      - What guy?

165
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:09,600
When I was going in,

166
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,954
you were about to have dinner with some guy, some bozo.

167
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:14,957
Oh, yeah. That bozo ended before dessert.

168
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,543
Well, that's his loss.

169
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:19,712
Yeah. They're all losers.

170
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:22,048
How many times have I told you that?

171
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,051
You want to get something to eat when we get back?

172
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:28,679
Is there a problem?

173
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,185
You're a horrible cook.

174
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:35,751
That's nice.

175
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:38,147
Well, you can complain in the morning.

176
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:40,858
Ouch.

177
00:15:48,825 --> 00:15:50,660
Morning, sir. How can I help you?

178
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,582
Mr. Breslin, I'm so sorry. I'm Jules.

179
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,168
That's okay. You're new here?

180
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:01,546
No, sir. I've been here five months.

181
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,506
- Five months? - Yes, sir.

182
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,678
What do you got for me?

183
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,596
Check it out.

184
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,184
That's good. Very smart.

185
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,635
Did you do this all by yourself?

186
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,022
I'm impressed. Genius.

187
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:22,024
You're smart, but...

188
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:26,195
Sorry, not smart enough.

189
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,532
Don't be bitter.

190
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:51,721
Mr. Breslin, they're ready for you in the conference room.

191
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:57,143
Morning, Les. Abby.

192
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,775
Jessica Mayer. It's an honor to meet you.

193
00:17:00,864 --> 00:17:02,690
Your work is the gold standard in the field.

194
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,900
What you've accomplished is remarkable.

195
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:11,407
Thank you. And you're here because...

196
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,242
She's Agency, Ray. As in...

197
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,910
Central Intelligence Agency.

198
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,120
You a SPY?

199
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,164
Worse. I'm a lawyer.

200
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,928
Ray, hear her out.

201
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,083
She's legit.

202
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,086
I called Langley myself.

203
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:28,007
Fine. I'll just listen. Go ahead.

204
00:17:29,342 --> 00:17:32,203
Mr. Breslin, after ending "extraordinary rendition,"

205
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:34,533
the Agency is looking for alternate situations

206
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:36,349
for incarcerating the sort of people

207
00:17:36,432 --> 00:17:38,678
who commit acts so despicable they're best...

208
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,935
Well, how can I put it?

209
00:17:40,394 --> 00:17:41,520
Eliminated?

210
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:45,483
Disappeared. And we're currently testing a prototype

211
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:48,277
to deal with people no government wants on their books.

212
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:49,748
But first and foremost,

213
00:17:49,887 --> 00:17:51,530
the people financing this need to know

214
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:53,491
these facilities are escape-proof

215
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:55,868
before the whole system goes online globally.

216
00:17:55,951 --> 00:17:58,000
What she's really saying is that none of this

217
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,664
is officially sanctioned by anyone.

218
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,165
Close.

219
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,375
What I'm saying, Miss Ross,

220
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:06,212
is that these facilities are privately funded and administered.

221
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,506
So the word "official" does not really apply.

222
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:09,590
So if anything goes wrong,

223
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:11,676
nothing comes back to bite you people in the ass.

224
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,011
This is not your concern.

225
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:16,305
I owe him. I don't owe you.

226
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:21,102
My job is to make sure the United States is safe and clean.

227
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,562
All right, can we just cut the crap and call it like it is?

228
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:25,911
These institutions are off the grid.

229
00:18:26,044 --> 00:18:27,066
There are no trials, there's no convictions.

230
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,235
These people are just disappeared.

231
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,362
And you want him to go in and test it?

232
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,852
Maybe it's time for me to interject into the conversation

233
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,178
that they have offered...

234
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,959
double your standard fee, that's five mil, right?

235
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:39,745
In advance.

236
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:41,539
So you like this?

237
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:42,900
Look, I'm a numbers guy.

238
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,500
You're the artist, Ray.

239
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:46,500
From a financial standpoint, I like it.

240
00:18:46,585 --> 00:18:47,837
Yes, I like it very much.

241
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:51,340
Beyond the money, Mr. Breslin,

242
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,259
the people that are sent to this place

243
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:55,761
should not be allowed out into the real world.

244
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:59,515
Every one of them is a potential game changer. For the worse.

245
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:00,850
All right.

246
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:06,439
Guidelines?

247
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,000
The usual. Full work. Alias. Cover story.

248
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,693
Contact. Evac number. Right?

249
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,270
Well, the only difference

250
00:19:12,274 --> 00:19:14,613
is to fully test the security of the system

251
00:19:14,697 --> 00:19:17,616
it's essential that none of you know the location of the incarceration.

252
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:20,494
Will that present a problem?

253
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:21,871
Yes. Yes, it would.

254
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:33,132
When do we start?

255
00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:34,717
We just did.

256
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,180
You and your new identity

257
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,223
will be picked up from this location

258
00:19:41,307 --> 00:19:44,143
by private contractors 24 hours from now.

259
00:20:03,913 --> 00:20:04,997
I don't like this.

260
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,081
And you don't like her.

261
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,833
Don't flatter yourself.

262
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:11,462
We're going against every protocol and guideline

263
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:15,299
that you yourself have insisted on every single time that you've gone in.

264
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,509
And I don't like her.

265
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:18,427
You're right. There's nothing to like about any of it.

266
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:19,135
Then why do it?

267
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,430
Because he's ambitious and greedy.

268
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,099
You say that like it's a bad thing.

269
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,727
Profile.

270
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:30,411
Name, Anthony Portos. Born Madrid.

271
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,441
Mother died when you were 13.

272
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,611
Raised by your father in the U.S.

273
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,878
You were suspected of manufacturing bombs

274
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,910
that have been used in a dozen political bombings

275
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:43,202
across Europe and South America for the last 10 years.

276
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:44,578
Contact on site?

277
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,122
Warden's name is Roger Marsh.

278
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:48,207
Evacuation code?

279
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,917
3-1-0-2-7-5.

280
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,298
All right. Let's do it.

281
00:20:56,382 --> 00:20:57,383
Tag him.

282
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:59,343
No. I don't need this. Really.

283
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:00,886
Yeah, you do. It's non-negotiable.

284
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,721
You think I'm letting you go in cold?

285
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,098
This gets old.

286
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:06,392
Man the fuck up.

287
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:08,394
Try it some time.

288
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:10,896
Sounds good, boss man. Any time you want to retire...

289
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,232
I've been taking notes. I'm ready to step up.

290
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,985
Where am I gonna find another techno-thug as gifted as you?

291
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,069
Freak of nature.

292
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah, very rare.

293
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:24,994
There you are, baby. Transponder's good.

294
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,831
It's like having me right on your shoulder.

295
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:30,416
Where else?

296
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:38,674
Hey, don't forget to write us. All right?

297
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:47,284
Shit!

298
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:24,196
Hold it!

299
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,465
Put him to sleep.

300
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,392
Prisoner 7458. Anthony Portos.

301
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,273
Welcome to the International Detainee Unit intake.

302
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,192
I'm Warden Hobbes.

303
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,153
Hobbes. Where's Warden Marsh?

304
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,448
There is no Warden Marsh.

305
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,706
What, am I disoriented? Is that it?

306
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,334
I guess that must be it.

307
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:08,253
And I didn't see a man killed on a transport helicopter

308
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,672
and thrown out either, right?

309
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:18,597
Mr. Portos, your intake is finished.

310
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,515
Wait!

311
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:23,477
My evacuation code is 3-1-0-2-7-5.

312
00:27:24,853 --> 00:27:26,188
Evacuation code?

313
00:27:26,271 --> 00:27:28,023
Yes. Evacuation code.

314
00:27:28,106 --> 00:27:30,069
Meaning you give me a number

315
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:32,778
and you walk out of here free as a bird?

316
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,699
No. I don't think so.

317
00:27:40,827 --> 00:27:44,122
You're here now. And you belong to me.

318
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,378
Your intake is finished.

319
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,714
Wait... I have an evacuation code!

320
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,049
Anything?

321
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,699
Getting a ghost bounce, same as yesterday.

322
00:27:56,135 --> 00:27:56,927
I can't find him.

323
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,012
You ran a full diagnostic on the system?

324
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,222
Twice.

325
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:01,932
Run it again.

326
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,730
All prisoners A-Block proceed to Babylon.

327
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:12,901
All prisoners A-Block to proceed to Babylon.

328
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,003
Portos.

329
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,506
Everybody's days are numbered in Babylon!

330
00:29:22,137 --> 00:29:24,973
Babylon, death, death!

331
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:47,037
Go make some friends. You're gonna need them.

332
00:30:44,845 --> 00:30:45,683
Stay down!

333
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:47,889
Stay down!

334
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,961
New fish. We own you!

335
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:22,591
Back off!

336
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,266
Last time.

337
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,228
Back away.

338
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:42,068
Portos.

339
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:47,199
Rottmayer. Emil Rottmayer.

340
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:51,119
Really not much in a hand-shaking mood right now.

341
00:31:53,246 --> 00:31:54,498
Okay.

342
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:57,542
Your name.

343
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,921
The fourth Musketeer. It's a good name.

344
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,384
Why are you in here?

345
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,387
Why do you care?

346
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:12,307
I used to work security for a guy by the name of Manheim.

347
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:17,729
Victor Manheim. Have you heard of the name?

348
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,274
Manheim, let me see... No.

349
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:23,902
- He's a genius. - Really?

350
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:25,360
He has this habit

351
00:32:25,365 --> 00:32:28,365
of taking money from the rich and giving it to the poor.

352
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,900
You've heard that story before...

353
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,159
I've heard that story. Yeah.

354
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,168
Now they're trying to find him.

355
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,165
But I'm not gonna help them.

356
00:32:37,832 --> 00:32:39,668
- Okay. - So fuck 'em!

357
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:42,087
Right. Fuck 'em.

358
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:48,260
Portos, don't get killed.

359
00:32:48,426 --> 00:32:49,553
If you say so.

360
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,846
Last time they killed a guy in here,

361
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,016
they let his body rot for three days.

362
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:00,897
And they canceled the prison dance.

363
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:08,029
Wouldn't want to fuck up the prom.

364
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,870
Morning, sir.

365
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:23,044
That's another beautiful piece, sir.

366
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,423
You lied to me.

367
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,434
I lied to you? I'm not sure what...

368
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,509
No, no.

369
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,971
You say nothing.

370
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:35,581
What am I supposed to tell the client

371
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:36,904
about the man you killed?

372
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,354
That he just jumped, like you said?

373
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:44,066
This isn't a free-for-all.

374
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:46,359
We're paid to prevent him from jumping.

375
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,780
And I can't get proof of life from a dead man.

376
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:52,907
So...

377
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:57,203
You will be docked the entire price of the asset.

378
00:33:57,704 --> 00:34:01,249
The entire price of the asset equals a month of my pay.

379
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,253
Then you're lucky the man you killed was not high value.

380
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,047
That is all, Drake.

381
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:46,972
Hey, Portos!

382
00:34:48,201 --> 00:34:49,005
Look at this.

383
00:34:50,673 --> 00:34:52,815
There's no sunrise, no sunset,

384
00:34:52,996 --> 00:34:55,470
but still they pray all the time.

385
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:58,473
Don't you find that interesting?

386
00:34:59,182 --> 00:35:00,266
Not really.

387
00:35:00,517 --> 00:35:01,900
You look like the kind of a guy

388
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,145
that finds things interesting.

389
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,648
You've done time before?

390
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,443
Why all the questions?

391
00:35:10,527 --> 00:35:12,320
That's how I learn things.

392
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,322
You really ought to study somebody else.

393
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:17,117
Portos!

394
00:35:18,451 --> 00:35:19,410
What?

395
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,829
Need a favor?

396
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:24,958
The favor man.

397
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:05,809
For a man who is not interested,

398
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,209
you're doing a lot of looking.

399
00:36:13,673 --> 00:36:14,966
What do you need?

400
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,511
I need to get into the isolation area.

401
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,347
No, you really don't.

402
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,404
Yeah, I really do.

403
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,727
Call it a favor.

404
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,396
Okay?

405
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:32,358
Okay.

406
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,444
Good.

407
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:42,660
That's a favor?

408
00:36:42,785 --> 00:36:44,370
Sometimes favors hurt.

409
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:46,164
Really?

410
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:47,999
- Come on. - Okay.

411
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,584
Let's see what you can do.

412
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,002
All right.

413
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,176
You hit like a vegetarian.

414
00:36:58,259 --> 00:37:00,011
- Do I? - You can do better than that.

415
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,682
Come on.

416
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,392
- All right. - Let's see it.

417
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:07,810
Try this.

418
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,190
Hun?

419
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:13,733
That was good.

420
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:15,235
Look what's coming!

421
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,702
Relax. It's pretend.

422
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:29,123
Guess boys will be boys.

423
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,126
That's enough.

424
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,717
Put them in the box! Now!

425
00:37:39,801 --> 00:37:41,302
You can thank me later.

426
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,857
They knew he was tagged.

427
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,799
Of course they knew.

428
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,109
Who do you think these guys are?

429
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,025
What do you think,

430
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,612
they're a bunch of yahoos from one of those BOP facilities?

431
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:43,103
This is the shadow world.

432
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:46,034
These guys, they invented this shit.

433
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,369
Why do you think they pay us all that money?

434
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,121
Remember what the guidelines were.

435
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:51,955
What the fuck are you talking about?

436
00:38:52,361 --> 00:38:53,516
There are no guidelines.

437
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:55,710
- Now, you call that CIA bitch. - Hush...

438
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,382
Motherfucker.

439
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:06,888
All right. I'll make the call.

440
00:39:08,848 --> 00:39:12,393
Abigail, you got to keep him away from me, all right?

441
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:30,745
Give me your arm.

442
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,151
You'll live.

443
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:05,029
How does a doctor work in a place like this?

444
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,240
Would you prefer there wasn't a doctor here?

445
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,617
Where is "here"?

446
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,997
Hey, Doc, let's wrap it up.

447
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,143
Doc...

448
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:37,979
What did he ask you?

449
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,731
He...

450
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:42,282
Wanted to know how his...

451
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:45,319
dehydration compared to the other detainees.

452
00:40:46,946 --> 00:40:48,239
And what did you tell him?

453
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,866
I don't care.

454
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,619
That's what I told him.

455
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,917
Get him out of there.

456
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,644
Did you find what you were looking for in the box?

457
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:27,093
All prisoners back to their cells.

458
00:41:27,541 --> 00:41:29,864
All prisoners back to their cells.

459
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:46,964
Who were you before you came in here, Portos?

460
00:41:48,925 --> 00:41:50,700
You're always watching the room,

461
00:41:50,714 --> 00:41:52,178
always watching everything.

462
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:54,764
- Are you asking what I used to do? - Yeah.

463
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,808
I'll tell you, but I need a little favor.

464
00:41:58,059 --> 00:41:59,143
Fuck that.

465
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:01,145
All right, don't do it.

466
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:02,809
All right, I'm listening.

467
00:42:03,117 --> 00:42:04,732
What's the favor this time?

468
00:42:05,233 --> 00:42:08,236
I need a piece of metal, about three inches wide.

469
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,363
Round, smooth.

470
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:12,184
No problem.

471
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:13,831
I'll hit the Home Depot,

472
00:42:14,013 --> 00:42:15,409
and I'll be right back. Okay?

473
00:42:17,370 --> 00:42:18,600
If you get me that piece of metal,

474
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,581
I might be able to get you out of here.

475
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:31,175
Tell Hobbes I want to talk.

476
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,778
Interrogation, ready for inmate.

477
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:39,141
Interrogation, ready for inmate.

478
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,894
You've been here six months now, Mr. Rottmayer.

479
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,732
So you know how this works.

480
00:42:48,943 --> 00:42:50,278
Ten seconds.

481
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,116
Where is Victor Manheim?

482
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:58,494
You know, to many people, he is a hero.

483
00:42:58,577 --> 00:42:59,912
Nine seconds.

484
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:01,706
Do you have a pencil and a piece of paper?

485
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:03,124
Eight seconds.

486
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,792
I could draw you a map.

487
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,378
Of what?

488
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,422
Where you could find him.

489
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,185
When I was a kid, I always wanted to be an artist.

490
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,646
My God, you are pushing it.

491
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:28,482
Problem was, I had no talent.

492
00:43:29,108 --> 00:43:30,359
Six seconds.

493
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:32,987
I tried and I tried and I tried...

494
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:34,196
Five...

495
00:43:35,323 --> 00:43:36,741
Do you ever have dreams?

496
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:37,867
Four...

497
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,118
Or did you always want to be...

498
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:40,578
- this? - Two...

499
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,038
- One... - Done.

500
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,835
Look. There.

501
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:52,757
I told you.

502
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:55,551
No talent.

503
00:43:57,553 --> 00:44:01,182
The records indicate that you are a highly intelligent man.

504
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:04,956
As such, I would have expected you to see the situation

505
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,937
and understand it for what it is.

506
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:08,930
In here, you have no control

507
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:11,108
over any part of your life,

508
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,277
except your breathing.

509
00:44:13,361 --> 00:44:15,029
And you just lost that privilege.

510
00:44:15,196 --> 00:44:16,238
Get him down!

511
00:44:52,066 --> 00:44:53,109
Keep going.

512
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,032
Enough.

513
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:44,535
What happened?

514
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:47,788
Nothing. I'm still here.

515
00:45:51,417 --> 00:45:52,751
Now it's your turn.

516
00:45:55,963 --> 00:45:58,424
I break out of prisons for a living.

517
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,301
For the past eight years,

518
00:46:00,384 --> 00:46:01,840
I've been breaking out of facilities

519
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,179
for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

520
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:06,200
I think Hobbes used my reports

521
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,350
to make this place unbreakable.

522
00:46:08,976 --> 00:46:10,640
Someone wanted this place tested,

523
00:46:11,155 --> 00:46:12,438
but it was a set-up.

524
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:14,693
They wanted to bury me. I don't know who,

525
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:16,357
but I'm gonna find out.

526
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:19,612
I need you to set up another diversion.

527
00:46:20,654 --> 00:46:21,906
What now?

528
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:23,908
You've got to go back in the box.

529
00:46:24,325 --> 00:46:25,618
No fucking way.

530
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,995
Want to get outta here?

531
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,666
Okay. I'll do it.

532
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:36,653
But if I don't get out,

533
00:46:37,865 --> 00:46:39,006
I kill you.

534
00:46:40,007 --> 00:46:41,592
Fair enough.

535
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,094
A successful breakout depends on three things,

536
00:46:44,178 --> 00:46:46,305
layout, routine, and help.

537
00:46:46,388 --> 00:46:49,183
- But they've taken those away. - For now.

538
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:51,530
There's something under the box.

539
00:46:51,535 --> 00:46:52,478
I think it's a conduit.

540
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:56,315
If it is, how do you know where it goes?

541
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,864
I don't. But I'm gonna find out.

542
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:06,116
This is good.

543
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,868
It's disgusting.

544
00:47:08,202 --> 00:47:09,710
The mind of a man confined

545
00:47:09,713 --> 00:47:12,289
works differently than someone on the outside.

546
00:47:12,373 --> 00:47:14,006
He sees things different.

547
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,960
The architecture is vertical.

548
00:47:16,418 --> 00:47:19,338
The cell blocks, Babylon, the box, the mess...

549
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:22,383
Everything's in large vertical compartments.

550
00:47:25,177 --> 00:47:27,400
Best guess is they built out underground

551
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:29,640
in large natural fissures and caves.

552
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:30,900
In a vertical structure,

553
00:47:30,923 --> 00:47:34,144
70/30 says whatever's under that box goes up.

554
00:47:34,228 --> 00:47:36,540
If I can get in there, follow where it goes,

555
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,274
I just might find my way to the surface.

556
00:47:40,234 --> 00:47:42,611
Let's say you're right. How do we cut metal?

557
00:47:42,695 --> 00:47:45,239
We don't cut. We don't cut at all.

558
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,550
This place is subterranean.

559
00:47:47,553 --> 00:47:49,159
There's moisture in the air.

560
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:50,300
Whoever built this place

561
00:47:50,303 --> 00:47:53,182
should have used aluminum rivets to hold those panels down,

562
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:54,248
but they used steel.

563
00:47:54,331 --> 00:47:56,000
Steel rusts over time.

564
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,000
We apply that.

565
00:47:59,031 --> 00:48:01,213
We'll concentrate the heat to those rivets

566
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:04,425
and they'll expand and snap right the fuck off.

567
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:06,635
Concentrated heat?

568
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:08,721
Yeah, from the piece of metal you gave me.

569
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:12,891
You expose a toothpaste-polished piece of metal to sunlight...

570
00:48:12,975 --> 00:48:14,852
- Or the lamps in the box. - Right.

571
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:16,626
At a hundred degrees centigrade,

572
00:48:16,737 --> 00:48:18,856
steel expands .03 cubic centimeters

573
00:48:18,939 --> 00:48:21,650
and those rivets are gonna come right off.

574
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:22,901
What?

575
00:48:23,777 --> 00:48:25,008
You don't look that smart.

576
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:26,655
You don't either.

577
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:29,533
So most prisons are built around small towns.

578
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:33,412
No matter how remote, they need supplies and a work force.

579
00:48:33,495 --> 00:48:34,872
If I can get to the surface,

580
00:48:34,955 --> 00:48:37,499
I'll know what it's going to take to get over the wall, get out of here.

581
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:40,586
But first I'm gonna need that diversion in the box.

582
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,713
How much time do you need?

583
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:44,340
Three to five minutes.

584
00:48:49,803 --> 00:48:51,263
No problem.

585
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:13,494
Step back.

586
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:15,537
I know you.

587
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,501
You don't know shit, you cunt-eater.

588
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:24,046
Now step back.

589
00:49:24,296 --> 00:49:25,547
Now I remember.

590
00:49:25,631 --> 00:49:26,632
What?

591
00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:30,219
Your mother, she was my favorite whore in Marrakesh.

592
00:49:31,303 --> 00:49:33,305
Man, she could polish a helmet!

593
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:09,633
No!

594
00:51:29,797 --> 00:51:32,549
You're killing me! You're killing me!

595
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,551
Bringing up box four, sir.

596
00:51:44,645 --> 00:51:46,563
Now, what is he up to?

597
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:56,782
Shut the fuck up, you German dog!

598
00:52:01,495 --> 00:52:03,705
Master control, please advise.

599
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:13,131
Just hold him till I get there.

600
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,220
I've got a camera malfunction, box two.

601
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,347
Roger that. Just reboot the system.

602
00:52:27,396 --> 00:52:28,522
Shit!

603
00:52:37,865 --> 00:52:39,199
Shut the fuck up!

604
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,470
Hey, Rottmayer, shut up!

605
00:52:44,473 --> 00:52:46,206
Restrain and drug him, sir?

606
00:52:46,373 --> 00:52:47,666
Not yet.

607
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,231
Lights off, box four.

608
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:17,446
Now open it.

609
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,747
Rough day, Mr. Rottmayer?

610
00:55:34,916 --> 00:55:35,917
Let's get 'em.

611
00:55:36,168 --> 00:55:39,046
Here's what you should know. I don't care.

612
00:55:39,212 --> 00:55:41,715
Sooner or later you will tell me what I want to know.

613
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:44,217
It is inevitable. Like dying.

614
00:55:44,718 --> 00:55:47,364
But know this, there will come a point

615
00:55:47,808 --> 00:55:50,664
where I don't give a shit about you

616
00:55:51,026 --> 00:55:53,477
or whatever the fuck you think you're doing right now.

617
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,563
So have a lovely day, Mr. Rottmayer.

618
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:33,832
Emergency personnel to level two.

619
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,811
Emergency personnel to level two.

620
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:39,022
Report?

621
00:56:39,106 --> 00:56:41,608
Valve breach on level two, sir. Electrical malfunction.

622
00:56:50,158 --> 00:56:51,368
Sir?

623
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:53,203
Get the assets out of there.

624
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:00,293
Open up!

625
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:13,140
Open the fucking door! Open the door!

626
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:40,917
- Did you make it? - Yeah.

627
00:57:41,001 --> 00:57:42,502
Where are we?

628
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,380
- Where are we? - I don't know!

629
00:57:46,006 --> 00:57:47,048
Fuck.

630
00:57:47,132 --> 00:57:48,091
They froze the check.

631
00:57:48,175 --> 00:57:49,426
What are we talking about here?

632
00:57:49,509 --> 00:57:51,845
The payment for Ray's services. They froze the check.

633
00:57:53,889 --> 00:57:56,224
It's not frozen, it's on hold. All right?

634
00:57:56,308 --> 00:57:58,643
It's very common in a $2.5 million transaction.

635
00:57:58,727 --> 00:58:00,834
No. Common would be a week, maybe 10 days.

636
00:58:00,934 --> 00:58:02,731
This has been way longer than that.

637
00:58:02,814 --> 00:58:05,650
Jesus, Abby. It's the federal government.

638
00:58:07,652 --> 00:58:09,237
You know how they work.

639
00:58:09,321 --> 00:58:10,280
Did you call that woman?

640
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:12,449
Yeah, I called. Everything is fine.

641
00:58:12,532 --> 00:58:13,825
Then where is he?

642
00:58:15,202 --> 00:58:17,454
He is on the job that he was hired to do.

643
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,831
So you're saying it's all good?

644
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,294
It's all good.

645
00:58:24,377 --> 00:58:26,254
Where was the breach?

646
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:29,257
The auxiliary ballast tank system on the starboard side.

647
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:32,469
Compartments five and seven have been compromised.

648
00:58:32,552 --> 00:58:35,889
And that leads to the ventilation shaft under box two.

649
00:58:38,058 --> 00:58:39,226
Portos.

650
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:53,240
Yeah, they're full of rust.

651
00:58:53,323 --> 00:58:55,533
Water pressure must have snapped them clean off.

652
00:58:57,911 --> 00:58:59,412
Maybe.

653
00:59:05,794 --> 00:59:07,671
Portos isn't his name, is it?

654
00:59:07,754 --> 00:59:09,339
Why wasn't I alerted?

655
00:59:09,422 --> 00:59:11,508
Look, it's like this. There's a lot of people paying money

656
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,511
to make sure that facility is unbreakable.

657
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:17,389
It's Ray Breslin. The great Ray Breslin.

658
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:20,560
He's there to prove that not even he can get out.

659
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,683
You make sure he stays there forever.

660
00:59:22,763 --> 00:59:23,853
Do you have a problem with that?

661
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:26,251
No. No. Not at all.

662
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,149
Just the opposite.

663
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:29,359
Fucker.

664
00:59:29,442 --> 00:59:31,861
All right, good. There's one more thing.

665
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,360
The Chinese banks

666
00:59:34,107 --> 00:59:36,491
have joined the Brazilians, the Russians,

667
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,225
the English, the U.S.

668
00:59:38,523 --> 00:59:39,828
and the Swiss banks.

669
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:41,200
They're all paying

670
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:43,873
to find out the whereabouts of this Manheim fellow.

671
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:46,334
Word on the street is that he has developed a program

672
00:59:46,418 --> 00:59:48,553
to turn the entire world banking system...

673
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:50,505
into fucking confetti.

674
00:59:50,588 --> 00:59:53,091
Rottmayer worked with that asshole. He knows where he is.

675
00:59:53,174 --> 00:59:55,760
Your job is to get that information out of him.

676
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,300
Well, it just so happens that

677
00:59:57,312 --> 00:59:59,514
since Breslin has gotten closer to Rottmayer,

678
00:59:59,973 --> 01:00:03,000
Rottmayer has developed a new edge to his defiance

679
01:00:03,051 --> 01:00:04,561
that wasn't there before.

680
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:07,230
I think Breslin is to blame.

681
01:00:08,106 --> 01:00:09,566
Then break Breslin.

682
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,192
Thank you.

683
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:15,822
I have an assignment I know you'll enjoy.

684
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:45,810
Get on your feet!

685
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,986
Wakey, wakey...

686
01:01:03,495 --> 01:01:04,871
Talk to me.

687
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:07,540
Come on. You must fight.

688
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,585
Get up!

689
01:01:10,668 --> 01:01:11,711
Stay on your feet!

690
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:13,671
If we're on a ship, we would know.

691
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:14,798
No.

692
01:01:14,881 --> 01:01:16,957
Not if it was 1,000 feet long,

693
01:01:17,207 --> 01:01:19,135
200 feet high, with stabilizers.

694
01:01:19,219 --> 01:01:21,054
We wouldn't know a damn thing.

695
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:24,766
Wakey, wakey! Get him on his feet.

696
01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:38,021
You can do it.

697
01:01:38,476 --> 01:01:39,989
Come on, go. Move it!

698
01:01:40,073 --> 01:01:41,324
We can't get out of here.

699
01:01:41,408 --> 01:01:42,575
- Yes, we can. - No!

700
01:01:45,703 --> 01:01:47,288
Get on your feet!

701
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,666
You've got to stay strong.

702
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:51,095
Back up! Back up!

703
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:53,837
It's you I want. Move it!

704
01:01:57,757 --> 01:01:59,259
Piece of shit...

705
01:02:15,984 --> 01:02:17,694
Stop it now, Drake.

706
01:02:35,962 --> 01:02:38,715
Don't give up. Don't let them break you.

707
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:42,260
What made you want to spend your life in prison?

708
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,474
Tell me. What made you do it?

709
01:02:50,018 --> 01:02:51,311
Tell me!

710
01:02:59,652 --> 01:03:02,322
I was a lawyer. Prosecutor.

711
01:03:03,656 --> 01:03:05,149
A man I put away...

712
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:07,660
made a promise to me.

713
01:03:08,203 --> 01:03:11,498
This man thought about that promise every day for three years,

714
01:03:12,499 --> 01:03:14,626
planning his way out of prison,

715
01:03:15,502 --> 01:03:18,254
planning on how he was gonna keep his word.

716
01:03:20,215 --> 01:03:22,425
Taking a man's life is nothing.

717
01:03:23,635 --> 01:03:24,969
Taking his heart...

718
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:28,348
That's everything, isn't it?

719
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:34,938
Everything.

720
01:03:45,156 --> 01:03:48,701
You see, putting people in prison wasn't good enough.

721
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:51,788
And I had to... I wanted to

722
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,041
make sure they stayed in there, didn't get out.

723
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,711
I understand. I have a daughter.

724
01:04:00,088 --> 01:04:01,472
Never forget them.

725
01:04:01,998 --> 01:04:03,174
You have a choice.

726
01:04:03,591 --> 01:04:04,884
You can die in here,

727
01:04:05,218 --> 01:04:06,535
or you can get out with me

728
01:04:06,876 --> 01:04:08,596
and punish who put you here.

729
01:04:10,056 --> 01:04:11,182
You hear me?

730
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:13,142
Yeah.

731
01:04:19,566 --> 01:04:20,567
Yeah.

732
01:04:21,234 --> 01:04:22,860
Good news and bad news.

733
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,717
I was thinking about that first meeting,

734
01:04:25,327 --> 01:04:26,781
privatized incarceration.

735
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:29,254
Off the grid, international profile.

736
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,326
And I started digging.

737
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:31,876
Code name, The Tomb.

738
01:04:31,957 --> 01:04:34,831
Completely for profit, totally illegal.

739
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:37,866
Run by ex-military assholes and Blackwater rejects.

740
01:04:38,013 --> 01:04:38,918
You know, bad dudes.

741
01:04:39,377 --> 01:04:41,170
If Ray is anywhere, it's here.

742
01:04:41,254 --> 01:04:43,089
Where is "here"?

743
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:45,091
That's the bad news.

744
01:04:47,218 --> 01:04:48,928
I don't know.

745
01:04:55,101 --> 01:04:57,020
No access to any layout.

746
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:00,607
No blind times.

747
01:05:03,234 --> 01:05:06,112
We're in the middle of the fucking ocean.

748
01:05:06,487 --> 01:05:09,532
But I'll be damned if I didn't find a routine.

749
01:05:10,408 --> 01:05:12,827
They scramble the guard shifts so they're never the same.

750
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:17,415
But they can't change the routine of the guards themselves.

751
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:21,085
We don't know when they start. We don't know when they end.

752
01:05:21,169 --> 01:05:24,464
But I do know where they're gonna be based on habit.

753
01:05:24,797 --> 01:05:26,707
See that guy coming down the stairs?

754
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,718
See how he walks all pigeon-toed?

755
01:05:28,801 --> 01:05:29,761
The Duck.

756
01:05:29,844 --> 01:05:32,000
Yeah. The Duck always works with the guy

757
01:05:32,022 --> 01:05:33,890
scratching the back of his neck.

758
01:05:33,973 --> 01:05:35,183
Hives.

759
01:05:36,434 --> 01:05:37,685
Yeah, Hives.

760
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:41,105
When Duck and Hives work together, they always do a circle.

761
01:05:41,189 --> 01:05:42,600
They may do it at random times of day.

762
01:05:42,614 --> 01:05:43,858
It doesn't matter when they do it,

763
01:05:43,941 --> 01:05:46,300
it always ends up being 128 strides,

764
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:48,112
then they split up. Watch.

765
01:05:49,155 --> 01:05:51,282
Now they each take a side.

766
01:05:51,366 --> 01:05:53,285
Duck walks 63 strides,

767
01:05:53,374 --> 01:05:55,328
Hives 65. Then they meet up at the top.

768
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:58,443
The guard down there at the bottom,

769
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:00,541
the heavy-set guy, he doesn't move much.

770
01:06:00,625 --> 01:06:02,198
My guess is he's been here a while

771
01:06:02,286 --> 01:06:04,379
and only does what he has to do.

772
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:05,505
Louisa.

773
01:06:07,048 --> 01:06:08,132
Louisa?

774
01:06:08,216 --> 01:06:10,593
His fat ass reminds me of my first girlfriend.

775
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:13,930
Nice.

776
01:06:14,514 --> 01:06:16,933
That guard over there could be a problem for us.

777
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:18,267
He's always looking around.

778
01:06:18,351 --> 01:06:20,645
- The Chicken Man. - Chicken Man, right.

779
01:06:22,021 --> 01:06:23,500
My guess, Chickie's new here.

780
01:06:23,552 --> 01:06:24,982
Does everything by the book.

781
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:27,568
- How do you know when the shift ends? - I don't.

782
01:06:27,652 --> 01:06:28,470
But around this time,

783
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,406
your girlfriend Louisa starts looking at her watch.

784
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:33,533
My guess, it's lunchtime.

785
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,287
Welcome back.

786
01:06:38,371 --> 01:06:39,539
Thanks.

787
01:06:40,498 --> 01:06:41,791
Now that we've got the routine,

788
01:06:41,874 --> 01:06:44,752
we just gotta ask the good doctor where the hell we are.

789
01:06:56,013 --> 01:06:58,391
I'm not permitted to give you anything for the pain,

790
01:06:58,474 --> 01:07:00,059
so don't request it.

791
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:03,271
You're a doctor. You took an oath.

792
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:06,399
"According to my ability and judgment,

793
01:07:06,733 --> 01:07:09,694
"I'll protect my patients from harm and injustice."

794
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,746
What you're doing here is wrong.

795
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:26,210
What exactly is it you want from me?

796
01:07:26,419 --> 01:07:28,421
I want to know where the hell I am.

797
01:07:43,269 --> 01:07:44,270
Guards!

798
01:07:48,941 --> 01:07:50,777
It's okay. It's under control.

799
01:07:51,194 --> 01:07:52,487
Put him back here.

800
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:04,791
Sorry.

801
01:08:19,305 --> 01:08:20,640
- So... - No.

802
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:22,725
Got to push him harder.

803
01:08:22,809 --> 01:08:24,727
Push him, we'll lose him.

804
01:08:24,811 --> 01:08:26,354
No other options?

805
01:08:26,437 --> 01:08:27,688
Plan B.

806
01:08:29,357 --> 01:08:31,609
You always gotta have a Plan B.

807
01:08:38,491 --> 01:08:39,617
Did you get it?

808
01:08:50,336 --> 01:08:52,380
Now I need his glasses.

809
01:10:05,077 --> 01:10:08,039
Sir? You want to take a look at this?

810
01:10:13,753 --> 01:10:15,838
- What's this? - It's a sextant.

811
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:19,717
Of course it is.

812
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,845
It works. You spot the North Star with the horizon.

813
01:10:22,929 --> 01:10:25,264
But it will only give us half of our location.

814
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:31,062
Bring Breslin.

815
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:34,400
I'll explain how it works later,

816
01:10:34,406 --> 01:10:36,192
but first we've got to get it topside.

817
01:10:36,275 --> 01:10:37,568
Watch out.

818
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:56,379
Welcome to your new home, Mr. Breslin.

819
01:10:57,546 --> 01:10:58,923
Section E.

820
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,467
Waiting for inmates.

821
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:03,052
You know who I am?

822
01:11:03,135 --> 01:11:04,637
I do now.

823
01:11:05,388 --> 01:11:07,659
I've studied your work very closely.

824
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:08,808
It's quite brilliant.

825
01:11:10,017 --> 01:11:11,100
As a matter of fact,

826
01:11:11,106 --> 01:11:14,480
it's what I used as a reference guide in designing this facility.

827
01:11:15,064 --> 01:11:16,774
If you know who I am, let me go.

828
01:11:16,857 --> 01:11:19,026
No, no, no, no, Mr. Breslin.

829
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:20,358
That's not how this works.

830
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:22,029
Not this time.

831
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:24,468
You see, the people who paid for you to be here

832
01:11:24,567 --> 01:11:26,081
want you here forever.

833
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,161
And knowing that, and knowing who you are,

834
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:32,289
well, who you were...

835
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:36,377
I can't have you communicating with Rottmayer,

836
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,671
or anybody else, for that matter.

837
01:11:38,754 --> 01:11:42,174
This is the reality. And there's no way out.

838
01:11:42,258 --> 01:11:43,801
This can go two ways.

839
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:46,053
You let me go and I'll pretend this never happened.

840
01:11:46,137 --> 01:11:46,800
You don't,

841
01:11:46,806 --> 01:11:50,516
and I'll burn this fucking place to the ground on my way out.

842
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:55,021
Effective right now, no mess, no rec time,

843
01:11:55,104 --> 01:11:57,481
and no showers.

844
01:11:58,607 --> 01:12:00,901
I can get you Victor Manheim.

845
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:04,697
Rottmayer trusts me.

846
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:07,992
So you say.

847
01:12:08,826 --> 01:12:09,869
Not good enough.

848
01:12:09,952 --> 01:12:10,900
What have you got to lose?

849
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:12,038
Finding him has got to be worth

850
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:14,582
a lot more than what you were paid for me, right, Hobbes?

851
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,459
It's a nice idea, but

852
01:12:16,542 --> 01:12:18,300
as it stands right now,

853
01:12:18,314 --> 01:12:20,087
I'm in line to get both.

854
01:12:20,796 --> 01:12:22,190
You'll never break Rottmayer.

855
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:24,341
He'll die before he turns.

856
01:12:25,051 --> 01:12:28,095
I'm your only chance to get what you want.

857
01:12:33,434 --> 01:12:35,682
I want Manheim and his whole network.

858
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:37,813
Names. Locations in real time.

859
01:12:37,897 --> 01:12:39,712
Get that. If it checks out, I'll let you go.

860
01:12:40,282 --> 01:12:41,025
But know this.

861
01:12:41,275 --> 01:12:43,986
You tell me every word that you and Rottmayer share,

862
01:12:44,070 --> 01:12:47,156
or I will personally pull the fucking life out of you.

863
01:12:47,865 --> 01:12:49,408
Fair enough.

864
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,291
So what happened?

865
01:12:57,416 --> 01:12:59,001
Rm playing you.

866
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:03,714
Last night Rottmayer told me he started his network

867
01:13:03,798 --> 01:13:06,258
with five guys from his hometown.

868
01:13:07,259 --> 01:13:09,637
He said he could trust his life to these guys.

869
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,180
Give Javed the sextant.

870
01:13:11,764 --> 01:13:14,600
Show him how to use it. Tell him it's his ticket outta here.

871
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:17,269
Javed. He'd rather see us dead.

872
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:19,522
He'll be the last one they suspect.

873
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:20,700
He bragged how his network

874
01:13:20,815 --> 01:13:23,734
caused the bank collapse in Iceland six years ago.

875
01:13:23,818 --> 01:13:25,853
I don't give a shit about six years ago.

876
01:13:26,047 --> 01:13:27,363
I want to know where he is now.

877
01:13:46,382 --> 01:13:48,008
You want to die?

878
01:13:49,176 --> 01:13:51,095
You want to get out?

879
01:13:58,644 --> 01:13:59,812
Today.

880
01:14:02,356 --> 01:14:03,899
They're plotting an escape.

881
01:14:03,983 --> 01:14:05,401
An escape?

882
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:08,445
Really? Who and when?

883
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:10,239
I don't know all the details.

884
01:14:11,824 --> 01:14:12,867
Just some.

885
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:15,452
Well, tell me the details you know.

886
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:20,666
You give me things first.

887
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,617
Mr. Alfredo, Afridi,

888
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,465
or whatever the fuck your name is...

889
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:30,980
Your opium drug cartel friends

890
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,345
have paid a lot of money for you to be here.

891
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:38,726
Of course they did, those fucks.

892
01:14:39,143 --> 01:14:40,978
So aside from your freedom,

893
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,398
what else can I give you?

894
01:14:45,191 --> 01:14:48,110
I want the guards to leave my people alone.

895
01:14:48,194 --> 01:14:49,862
The Holy Koran...

896
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,199
I want one in my cell.

897
01:14:53,908 --> 01:14:56,327
And I want to say the name of Allah

898
01:14:56,952 --> 01:15:00,039
and the prophet Mohammed in the open air.

899
01:15:02,041 --> 01:15:04,126
I want to be seen by my God

900
01:15:05,586 --> 01:15:08,047
when I say my evening prayers.

901
01:15:09,715 --> 01:15:10,925
That's all?

902
01:15:11,467 --> 01:15:12,927
That's all.

903
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,141
I want to be seen by my God, Mr. Hobbes!

904
01:17:17,801 --> 01:17:19,678
30 degrees, 22 minutes.

905
01:17:20,387 --> 01:17:22,473
We're in Horse Latitudes, calm water.

906
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,224
North or south?

907
01:17:24,308 --> 01:17:26,600
Water goes counter-clockwise above the equator,

908
01:17:26,723 --> 01:17:27,478
so we're north.

909
01:17:27,561 --> 01:17:29,104
How do we get the longitude?

910
01:17:29,897 --> 01:17:31,604
They brought a new fish in yesterday.

911
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:33,984
He said it was November 20th.

912
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:38,030
We've got warm rain, warm air at sea in November.

913
01:17:38,989 --> 01:17:40,991
Now, you're building a secret facility.

914
01:17:41,617 --> 01:17:43,452
You're putting it on the water.

915
01:17:43,535 --> 01:17:45,600
You're at 30 degrees north latitude

916
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:47,206
because you want to avoid rough water.

917
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,293
So you're going to want to stay away from the Caribbean and the Pacific,

918
01:17:51,377 --> 01:17:53,629
say, east of the China Sea.

919
01:17:55,798 --> 01:17:56,600
If I was a betting man,

920
01:17:56,660 --> 01:17:59,593
I'd say we could be off the coast of Morocco.

921
01:17:59,676 --> 01:18:00,736
It's just a guess.

922
01:18:00,892 --> 01:18:02,805
International waters. Calm sea.

923
01:18:02,888 --> 01:18:04,897
Close enough to land for supplies.

924
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,183
Educated guess.

925
01:18:06,475 --> 01:18:08,037
I know a guy in Casablanca.

926
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:09,937
He owes me big-time.

927
01:18:10,145 --> 01:18:11,897
Enough to come and get you?

928
01:18:12,940 --> 01:18:14,691
He'd still owe me.

929
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:19,238
There's only one way to get a message out. One way.

930
01:18:21,615 --> 01:18:23,075
My God...

931
01:18:28,956 --> 01:18:31,917
What is this? You swallowed clotting powder?

932
01:18:36,171 --> 01:18:39,341
Listen to me. I know you think I'm playing you.

933
01:18:39,716 --> 01:18:41,677
In Hobbes' office is a book.

934
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:45,472
Compromising Correctional Institution Security by Ray Breslin.

935
01:18:45,848 --> 01:18:48,000
On page 88 is a detailed description

936
01:18:48,057 --> 01:18:50,686
of Cell Block C at Lewisburg Federal Prison.

937
01:18:52,271 --> 01:18:53,355
Guards!

938
01:18:53,856 --> 01:18:56,942
Check it out. And remember your oath.

939
01:19:01,321 --> 01:19:02,700
I can't stall Hobbes anymore.

940
01:19:02,774 --> 01:19:04,324
I've got to give him a location.

941
01:19:04,408 --> 01:19:06,410
But we still don't have a plan.

942
01:19:06,493 --> 01:19:08,787
It's in the doctor's hands.

943
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:01,590
Medical personnel, Interrogation Three.

944
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:04,051
Medical personnel, Interrogation Three.

945
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:05,385
Guards!

946
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:08,722
Bring me prisoner Portos from E Block.

947
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:13,852
Hobbes' orders. Do it now.

948
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:23,278
Breathe in.

949
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:29,618
Again.

950
01:20:31,495 --> 01:20:34,665
I saw the book. How did you know?

951
01:20:34,748 --> 01:20:37,251
I'm Ray Breslin. I wrote the book.

952
01:20:46,510 --> 01:20:47,861
Doctors are men who...

953
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,556
prescribe medicines of which they know little

954
01:20:51,098 --> 01:20:53,433
to cure diseases of which they know less

955
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:56,562
for men of whom they know nothing at all.

956
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:03,777
What do you want me to do?

957
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:16,373
The doctor is in. Now Javed has to do his part.

958
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:25,977
Manheim's main base of operations

959
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,051
is 20 miles outside of Ruse.

960
01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:31,555
That's on the Bulgarian-Romanian border.

961
01:21:37,352 --> 01:21:38,520
See?

962
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,316
Ratting out your friends ain't so hard.

963
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,100
We've got 24 hours

964
01:21:49,182 --> 01:21:52,701
before Hobbes realizes the Bulgarian location is bullshit.

965
01:21:52,784 --> 01:21:54,745
Who do you know in C Block?

966
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:03,170
They've given permission for your midnight prayer,

967
01:22:03,253 --> 01:22:05,380
so what do you have for me?

968
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:17,434
- Lock in on Breslin. - Yes, sir.

969
01:22:21,063 --> 01:22:22,606
What are we up to?

970
01:22:27,152 --> 01:22:28,236
Louder

971
01:22:29,029 --> 01:22:30,697
Louder. Louder!

972
01:22:31,073 --> 01:22:32,199
Got you.

973
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,455
Decode it.

974
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:07,150
Stop.

975
01:23:10,821 --> 01:23:11,988
Zoom in.

976
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:15,367
It's Makmar Hassan.

977
01:23:19,538 --> 01:23:22,541
Breslin is gonna have Hassan start the break from Cell Block C.

978
01:23:23,083 --> 01:23:24,710
We have a time frame.

979
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:28,880
And we have a location.

980
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,593
Cell Block C.

981
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,159
Triple the guard force there.

982
01:23:36,235 --> 01:23:38,098
I want to know everyone who's involved.

983
01:23:38,682 --> 01:23:39,975
You will, sir.

984
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:44,563
Cell Block C, prepare for inspection.

985
01:23:56,575 --> 01:23:58,128
Louisa and Chicken Man.

986
01:23:58,449 --> 01:24:00,579
They sent everyone else to Cell Block C.

987
01:24:03,707 --> 01:24:05,876
You better be fuckin' right.

988
01:24:05,959 --> 01:24:07,502
Don't worry.

989
01:24:11,133 --> 01:24:13,290
You fucking white trash scumbag bitch!

990
01:24:14,301 --> 01:24:16,803
Where are you going, you fucking towel-head al-Qaeda faggot?

991
01:24:17,012 --> 01:24:19,973
- Hey, your fuckin' sister gives... - Fuck you, you diaper-head...

992
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,892
You fuckin' skinhead! You motherfuckin'...

993
01:24:28,648 --> 01:24:30,442
The break was never happening in Block C.

994
01:24:39,034 --> 01:24:42,162
All men from C to Babylon. Right now.

995
01:25:02,307 --> 01:25:03,350
Come on!

996
01:25:37,425 --> 01:25:38,718
Come on!

997
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:43,515
Where the fuck is Breslin?

998
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:47,102
Go, go, go! Let's move!

999
01:26:05,745 --> 01:26:07,100
We've got 11 minutes to get topside.

1000
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:08,415
Let's hope the doc made contact.

1001
01:26:14,296 --> 01:26:15,755
Go. Go.

1002
01:26:25,765 --> 01:26:26,808
What are you doing?

1003
01:26:27,434 --> 01:26:30,729
All the cameras are connected. We've gotta block 'em out.

1004
01:26:30,812 --> 01:26:32,397
Sir!

1005
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,364
Say "cheese."

1006
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:52,208
Come on.

1007
01:27:01,843 --> 01:27:03,970
Okay. All right, this is it. Let's go.

1008
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:07,015
Engage security protocol five.

1009
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:09,123
Lockdown procedure engaged.

1010
01:27:09,221 --> 01:27:11,269
Lockdown procedure engaged.

1011
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,962
It's a full lockdown. We're all locked inside.

1012
01:27:37,045 --> 01:27:38,380
Eight minutes.

1013
01:27:39,506 --> 01:27:40,507
They're out of moves.

1014
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:42,484
Drake, take two units.

1015
01:27:44,188 --> 01:27:46,385
Drag the rats back to their cages.

1016
01:28:04,155 --> 01:28:05,365
Hold up.

1017
01:28:28,805 --> 01:28:30,390
Javed!

1018
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,779
Open gate three!

1019
01:28:36,123 --> 01:28:37,480
Take 'em!

1020
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:49,951
Go, go, go, go! Don't fucking lose them!

1021
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:55,373
Breslin!

1022
01:28:56,875 --> 01:29:00,003
Breslin! Open before I break you, you motherfucker!

1023
01:29:01,963 --> 01:29:05,258
You'll never get out of here alive, you arsehole!

1024
01:29:05,341 --> 01:29:06,456
We're gonna kill you!

1025
01:29:06,947 --> 01:29:08,219
We've gotta move!

1026
01:29:18,146 --> 01:29:21,983
Smash that door down. I'll come around from the other side.

1027
01:29:22,067 --> 01:29:24,152
Breslin, how the hell do they know where we are?

1028
01:29:24,235 --> 01:29:26,071
You turned off the cameras, right?

1029
01:29:34,954 --> 01:29:36,664
Motion detector.

1030
01:29:36,873 --> 01:29:37,916
Sir!

1031
01:29:39,042 --> 01:29:40,210
Out.

1032
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,682
You can play your games all day, Mr. Breslin,

1033
01:29:54,782 --> 01:29:57,435
but I'm still in control.

1034
01:29:58,144 --> 01:30:00,605
Whatever you do, I have the power.

1035
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:03,858
I own your ass.

1036
01:30:05,443 --> 01:30:07,737
You guys have gotta get up that ladder.

1037
01:30:07,821 --> 01:30:10,198
I've got to find the engine room and shut the power grid down.

1038
01:30:10,281 --> 01:30:12,367
Those magnetic locks will stay open for about

1039
01:30:12,450 --> 01:30:14,536
five seconds before the back-up generator kicks in.

1040
01:30:14,619 --> 01:30:17,789
You understand? That's all the time you're gonna have.

1041
01:30:21,292 --> 01:30:23,169
Take this. Take it.

1042
01:30:25,255 --> 01:30:26,881
You're a good man.

1043
01:30:27,465 --> 01:30:28,675
Go do it.

1044
01:30:30,468 --> 01:30:32,137
- What about you? - I'll be right behind you.

1045
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:33,680
What if you're not on the deck at 5:00?

1046
01:30:33,763 --> 01:30:35,351
Do what you've got to do.

1047
01:30:35,683 --> 01:30:37,308
There's always Plan B.

1048
01:30:46,151 --> 01:30:47,694
Come on. Let's do it.

1049
01:30:47,777 --> 01:30:49,904
We're dead men. There's no way out.

1050
01:30:49,988 --> 01:30:51,614
- Come with me. - I won't make it up that ladder.

1051
01:30:51,698 --> 01:30:53,366
- I'll carry you up the ladder. - But I can hold them back.

1052
01:30:53,449 --> 01:30:55,368
No. I can carry you up the ladder.

1053
01:30:55,451 --> 01:30:56,600
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

1054
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,288
Give me your gun.

1055
01:31:00,206 --> 01:31:01,875
Just give me your gun.

1056
01:31:14,470 --> 01:31:15,972
Allah be with you.

1057
01:31:16,890 --> 01:31:18,808
I'll see you up there.

1058
01:31:19,726 --> 01:31:21,144
Now go.

1059
01:31:23,021 --> 01:31:24,564
Take care.

1060
01:31:49,047 --> 01:31:50,048
Fuck!

1061
01:31:51,925 --> 01:31:52,967
Report?

1062
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:54,594
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

1063
01:31:54,677 --> 01:31:57,222
We're taking gunfire on the lower deck!

1064
01:31:58,389 --> 01:32:00,516
If he made it to the lower deck, he's going to the engine room.

1065
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:02,977
Meet me in the engine room. I'm coming down.

1066
01:32:03,061 --> 01:32:04,020
Copy.

1067
01:32:04,103 --> 01:32:06,522
- Get that fucker out of there! - Yes, sir.

1068
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:15,657
Clear!

1069
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:37,155
Yeah. Whatever.

1070
01:34:06,184 --> 01:34:08,019
Having trouble breathing?

1071
01:34:25,870 --> 01:34:28,039
I'm gonna fucking kill ya, motherfucker!

1072
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:35,713
Back off!

1073
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:57,985
- Did you see him? - Yeah, he's here.

1074
01:34:58,069 --> 01:34:59,112
- We're on our way... - I'll take care of it.

1075
01:34:59,195 --> 01:35:00,696
No, wait, wait!

1076
01:35:41,487 --> 01:35:43,114
He's still on port, sir.

1077
01:35:47,827 --> 01:35:49,036
What the fuck?

1078
01:35:54,459 --> 01:35:55,918
Go! Get down!

1079
01:36:06,804 --> 01:36:08,264
We have a situation up here!

1080
01:36:09,891 --> 01:36:10,975
Fuck!

1081
01:36:42,673 --> 01:36:43,841
Go, go!

1082
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:49,764
Plan B.

1083
01:36:49,847 --> 01:36:51,349
No one gets off this ship.

1084
01:36:53,184 --> 01:36:54,310
Shoot to kill.

1085
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,375
Go, go!

1086
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:26,968
- We have to go now! - Not yet!

1087
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:54,870
Give yourself up, Mr. Breslin.

1088
01:37:55,955 --> 01:37:58,749
You can run around, make some noise...

1089
01:38:03,296 --> 01:38:05,131
Spill some blood.

1090
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:07,008
You can't get out.

1091
01:38:08,593 --> 01:38:10,011
Not really...

1092
01:38:10,595 --> 01:38:14,098
I know about your wife, your son.

1093
01:38:18,561 --> 01:38:19,979
I know every detail.

1094
01:38:20,438 --> 01:38:21,530
So thank you

1095
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:25,276
for pointing out all the small flaws in my creation.

1096
01:38:26,444 --> 01:38:28,696
I'll be sure to fortify them.

1097
01:38:30,406 --> 01:38:32,033
But your time's up.

1098
01:38:33,117 --> 01:38:34,785
You hear me?

1099
01:38:35,286 --> 01:38:36,454
Breslin?

1100
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:40,625
Your time is up.

1101
01:38:46,631 --> 01:38:48,460
No one in. No one out.

1102
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,593
Search every inch of this fucking room.

1103
01:38:51,469 --> 01:38:52,845
And power this thing back up!

1104
01:38:53,596 --> 01:38:55,973
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

1105
01:39:25,002 --> 01:39:26,462
- Let's roll! - Go!

1106
01:39:55,574 --> 01:39:56,617
Breslin!

1107
01:40:12,758 --> 01:40:13,801
Go down!

1108
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:21,559
Come on, let's go! Down, down!

1109
01:40:40,578 --> 01:40:42,538
We're gonna have to back off!

1110
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:52,882
Rottmayer! Gun!

1111
01:40:53,883 --> 01:40:55,217
- Gun! - Give me your gun!

1112
01:41:37,009 --> 01:41:38,093
Boom.

1113
01:41:51,023 --> 01:41:54,443
Have a lovely day, asshole!

1114
01:42:29,353 --> 01:42:30,396
Now what?

1115
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:31,689
Relax.

1116
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:12,521
You met her before.

1117
01:43:12,605 --> 01:43:15,107
Jessica Mayer. It's an honor to meet you.

1118
01:43:15,190 --> 01:43:17,109
Your work is the gold standard in the field.

1119
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:19,778
She has been my eyes and ears inside the Agency.

1120
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:21,071
Hello, Dad.

1121
01:43:21,405 --> 01:43:23,115
And she's also my daughter.

1122
01:43:24,033 --> 01:43:25,784
Hello, darling.

1123
01:43:25,868 --> 01:43:27,536
Thank God you made it.

1124
01:43:29,079 --> 01:43:30,497
I missed you.

1125
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:33,542
What happened?

1126
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:35,127
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

1127
01:43:37,755 --> 01:43:38,756
You're Manheim.

1128
01:43:42,051 --> 01:43:43,677
Didn't see that coming.

1129
01:43:43,928 --> 01:43:44,887
You should've.

1130
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,221
Yeah.

1131
01:43:50,351 --> 01:43:51,435
How'd you do it?

1132
01:43:51,685 --> 01:43:53,437
We have code names.

1133
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:56,732
Code name Rottmayer meant maximum security incarceration.

1134
01:43:59,818 --> 01:44:02,738
When my dad was picked up, it activated the code.

1135
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:04,949
And that's when you called Les Clark.

1136
01:44:05,199 --> 01:44:06,481
I needed the best.

1137
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:08,369
And after you agreed to do it,

1138
01:44:08,827 --> 01:44:12,039
I used my contacts deep inside the DHS to get you in.

1139
01:44:12,122 --> 01:44:14,375
And the name you gave me was the I.D. code.

1140
01:44:14,458 --> 01:44:15,501
Portos.

1141
01:44:17,294 --> 01:44:19,338
Rottmayer. Emil Rottmayer.

1142
01:44:19,922 --> 01:44:22,132
And I became your best friend.

1143
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,531
You are not user-friendly.

1144
01:44:27,946 --> 01:44:29,890
I had to work very hard.

1145
01:44:30,307 --> 01:44:33,227
And that damn box. That was hot.

1146
01:44:33,602 --> 01:44:35,312
It did get warm, yeah.

1147
01:44:35,771 --> 01:44:36,824
But it doesn't matter.

1148
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:39,942
What matters is that I'm out and so are you.

1149
01:44:41,610 --> 01:44:43,821
We both served enough time.

1150
01:44:45,406 --> 01:44:47,157
You want to try it again?

1151
01:44:49,243 --> 01:44:51,036
You son-of-a-bitch...

1152
01:44:55,874 --> 01:44:57,501
I hope I never see you again.

1153
01:44:57,584 --> 01:44:59,003
That hurts.

1154
01:45:06,343 --> 01:45:08,012
One more thing!

1155
01:45:09,346 --> 01:45:10,764
How much did Les really know?

1156
01:45:10,848 --> 01:45:12,425
Only what I told him, at first.

1157
01:45:12,535 --> 01:45:13,726
But the next thing I know,

1158
01:45:13,809 --> 01:45:14,750
he's gone around me

1159
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,895
and offered his services to the backers of The Tomb.

1160
01:45:16,979 --> 01:45:19,106
So he knew where I was being sent?

1161
01:45:19,189 --> 01:45:21,316
He arranged your transport.

1162
01:45:22,776 --> 01:45:23,777
Need a ride?

1163
01:45:24,528 --> 01:45:27,448
No, thanks. I made my own arrangements.

1164
01:45:42,129 --> 01:45:44,631
Wasn't tracking. We knew something wasn't right.

1165
01:45:45,174 --> 01:45:47,092
Red flags going up all over the place.

1166
01:45:47,468 --> 01:45:50,137
Clark was too calm about it, so we started digging.

1167
01:45:51,055 --> 01:45:52,639
We found out he'd been offered the CEO job

1168
01:45:52,723 --> 01:45:54,224
of running the whole Tomb program

1169
01:45:54,308 --> 01:45:56,852
if the prototype you were buried in proved inescapable.

1170
01:45:56,935 --> 01:45:59,438
At a salary of $5 million a year, plus stock options.

1171
01:45:59,521 --> 01:46:00,647
Tell me you tracked him down.

1172
01:46:00,731 --> 01:46:03,317
Just like you asked. The plan's in motion as we speak.

1173
01:46:16,246 --> 01:46:18,248
It's sleepy-time, motherfucker.

1174
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:34,598
Oh, fuck!

1175
01:46:37,935 --> 01:46:40,145
No, no... Come on, come on, come on...

1176
01:46:43,482 --> 01:46:45,025
Fuck!

1177
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:46,902
Ray!

1178
01:46:47,402 --> 01:46:48,612
Fuck!

1179
01:46:51,949 --> 01:46:54,952
Ray!

1180
01:46:59,790 --> 01:47:01,792
- It's Hush. - What did he say?

1181
01:47:02,835 --> 01:47:04,336
It's all good.

1182
01:47:05,003 --> 01:47:06,296
Good.

1183
01:47:08,924 --> 01:47:10,175
- What's that? - Job offers.

1184
01:47:10,259 --> 01:47:13,887
Maybe later. Why don't you and me have a very special dinner.

1185
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:15,848
I'll cook.

1186
01:47:16,473 --> 01:47:18,559
Haven't I suffered enough?
