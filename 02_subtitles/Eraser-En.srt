1
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:13,016
You couldn't hide, Johnny!
Nobody hides from us!

2
00:03:18,024 --> 00:03:19,013
Shit!

3
00:03:19,192 --> 00:03:21,752
Get me ice. I broke my goddamn hand.

4
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,259
Sure, boss.

5
00:03:40,914 --> 00:03:42,245
Fuck you!

6
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:43,575
Just do me!

7
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,750
Sure, Johnny. But first...

8
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,012
...Mr. Canelli wants a little souvenir.

9
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,513
Open up!

10
00:03:52,692 --> 00:03:53,852
Open up!

11
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:57,019
We'll send this to your
Witness Protection buddies.

12
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,256
See if it sings on its own.

13
00:03:59,532 --> 00:04:01,864
They can take it to the trial.

14
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:03,195
Open up!

15
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,537
Benny?

16
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:28,624
Who the hell are you?

17
00:04:36,736 --> 00:04:37,464
Close your eyes.

18
00:04:37,637 --> 00:04:38,228
Who are you?!

19
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:38,995
Shut up!

20
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:45,806
You too!

21
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:46,809
It's okay.

22
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,913
Do what he says.

23
00:04:50,316 --> 00:04:52,409
Don't move. You're dead.

24
00:04:57,323 --> 00:04:59,416
I need the clothes you're wearing.

25
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:00,820
Your ring.

26
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:02,154
Your watch.

27
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:03,994
All your IDs.

28
00:05:04,264 --> 00:05:05,322
Now.

29
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:06,656
Do it!

30
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,103
Come with me.

31
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,335
Grab the other one.

32
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,112
Let's go.

33
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:42,126
Put your clothes on them. Move!

34
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:10,218
There's been a murder
at 232 Alden Drive.

35
00:06:10,563 --> 00:06:11,996
Send the police.

36
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,334
They killed you, then
turned on each other.

37
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,828
Right.

38
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,564
You sons-of-bitches.

39
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,673
Shit!

40
00:06:29,916 --> 00:06:31,907
This doesn't work without an audience.

41
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,521
Outside. Let's go.

42
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,705
Get in.

43
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,729
Thank you.

44
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:28,465
Thank you. Anything you
ever need, just ask me.

45
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:32,077
You endangered your life and
the U.S. Marshals protecting you.

46
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:33,234
What?

47
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:35,404
You went to your old restaurant.

48
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:39,483
You went back to Gennaro's?
Johnny, are you stupid?!

49
00:07:39,652 --> 00:07:41,142
It's the osso buco.

50
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,255
I was fucking dying for a decent meal!

51
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:47,325
Next time, you're dead!
This only happens once.

52
00:07:53,766 --> 00:07:55,097
Get out.

53
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:11,949
That was our ride!

54
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,652
Let's go.

55
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:16,686
Go.

56
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,184
You won't see me again.
But I'll know your every move.

57
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,454
Use your heads, lie low
and no one will hurt you.

58
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:28,964
Skip out on your testimony and I'll
deliver you to the Canelli family.

59
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:30,291
I promise.

60
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,962
I owe you big time. I'm a
stand-up guy, you got it?

61
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,304
You ever need anything, you
let me know. What's your name?

62
00:08:38,478 --> 00:08:40,378
Honey, he doesn't want to be pen pals.

63
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,481
Smile. You've just been erased.

64
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,909
John, would you look at something?

65
00:09:18,184 --> 00:09:21,676
One is from our shop, the others
are real. What do you think?

66
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:29,017
That's the fake.

67
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:32,595
Who the hell is that?

68
00:09:32,765 --> 00:09:34,596
If I tell you, I'd have to kill you.

69
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,701
Shut up and run this again.

70
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:26,146
With a little sleight of hand...

71
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:30,915
...one very dead John Doe trades
places with one very live scumbag.

72
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,580
Robert, sit down.

73
00:10:34,493 --> 00:10:35,585
You know...

74
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:41,597
...if God was as forgiving as WITSEC...

75
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,667
...hell would be one empty joint.

76
00:10:44,003 --> 00:10:45,834
God doesn't have our court system.

77
00:10:48,174 --> 00:10:50,938
I understand you had a busy night.

78
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,002
A witness got careless.

79
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:55,170
-I see.
-I had to defuse the situation.

80
00:10:55,348 --> 00:10:58,442
And that included breaking
into the county morgue?

81
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:03,351
Someone taught me that improvisation
is the heart of field work.

82
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:04,888
It was you.

83
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,615
In the old days. Weather's changed.

84
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,956
Now every asshole in
Congress is down our backs.

85
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,791
I'm telling you to walk softly.

86
00:11:13,032 --> 00:11:16,468
That's why Beller called me in?
Because of the morgue?

87
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,033
No, no, no.

88
00:11:19,038 --> 00:11:21,472
He doesn't know anything about that.

89
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:23,199
I don't think he has to.

90
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,973
Shadow Ops still has some privileges.

91
00:11:27,046 --> 00:11:28,308
You're right.

92
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,146
John...

93
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,645
...good work.

94
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:35,385
I had a good teacher.

95
00:11:35,888 --> 00:11:37,150
Bullshit.

96
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:38,722
You had the best.

97
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:48,492
14,640 some-odd people
under WITSEC protection...

98
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:51,398
...and not one with a profile like this.

99
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,662
That bad?

100
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,671
That good. This young
lady, Miss Cullen...

101
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,509
...is a real live, bona fide...

102
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:00,670
...honest person.

103
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,507
Then why does she need us?

104
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:05,683
She's a senior executive
at Cyrez Corporation.

105
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,012
They're major defense contractors.

106
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:09,745
Top-secret weapons research.

107
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:13,756
Looks like someone inside
Cyrez is selling out Uncle Sam.

108
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:16,187
Feds need her to prove their case.

109
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,593
She's the key witness in the
hottest scandal since lran-Contra.

110
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:21,524
-When does this go down?
-Tomorrow.

111
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:25,432
The sting's in place.
When it's over, she's all yours.

112
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:28,196
Sealed file on relocate.
Your eyes only.

113
00:12:28,374 --> 00:12:32,367
As usual, only you and I will be privy
to the exact location of your witness.

114
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:33,705
But, John...

115
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,379
...there are some serious
players in Washington...

116
00:12:38,017 --> 00:12:39,541
...who could be badly burned.

117
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:45,954
So could she.

118
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:07,906
Welcome to Cyrez Corporation.

119
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:19,588
Morning, Dave.

120
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:27,996
She's in.

121
00:13:30,002 --> 00:13:31,094
Anything yet?

122
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,259
Not yet.

123
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,601
That's right, lady. We're right here.

124
00:13:56,962 --> 00:13:57,951
We're on.

125
00:14:02,501 --> 00:14:03,331
Hear me?

126
00:14:03,536 --> 00:14:04,696
We hear you.

127
00:14:04,904 --> 00:14:05,893
I look okay?

128
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,629
Tell her she looks great.

129
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:09,365
Not bad, Miss Cullen.

130
00:14:10,142 --> 00:14:11,541
Not bad for an amateur.

131
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,478
We're right with you.

132
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,380
Yeah.

133
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,142
Then let's do it.

134
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:27,649
-Good morning, Miss Cullen.
-Good morning.

135
00:14:27,827 --> 00:14:28,816
Station C?

136
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:31,160
Yes.

137
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,230
And how long today?

138
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:34,724
10 minutes.

139
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:38,058
Okay.

140
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:57,254
You're doing just fine, Lee.

141
00:15:14,607 --> 00:15:16,871
Hope we bought the right combination.

142
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:19,911
Bingo!

143
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,275
Shit!

144
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:28,284
It's okay. We lose
transmission in the vault.

145
00:15:28,621 --> 00:15:29,713
What now?

146
00:15:30,122 --> 00:15:31,612
Now we wait.

147
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:36,794
She's only got 5 minutes
till the shift change.

148
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,797
What's taking so long?

149
00:16:47,032 --> 00:16:49,796
Sweetheart, you've got 2 minutes left.

150
00:17:28,507 --> 00:17:29,838
Shouldn't have used her.

151
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,738
Shit! She's out of time.

152
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,271
Welcome back, Lee. We're with you.

153
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,007
Miss Cullen...

154
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,912
...Mr. Donahue would like to see you.

155
00:18:13,085 --> 00:18:14,518
In a minute.

156
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:16,245
He said right now.

157
00:18:16,522 --> 00:18:18,353
-What's going on?
-They made us.

158
00:18:30,369 --> 00:18:33,270
Check the directory.
Where's Donahue's office?

159
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:35,031
25th floor.

160
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:36,196
I know.

161
00:18:36,542 --> 00:18:37,600
25th floor.

162
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:40,267
Get ready to roll. It could go south.

163
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:44,548
What is it, William?

164
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:52,222
Someone I trusted for 5 years.

165
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:55,387
Someone I told others could be trusted.

166
00:18:56,061 --> 00:18:57,323
I was pulling--

167
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:58,258
Don't!

168
00:18:59,631 --> 00:19:02,293
We're way beyond bullshit here.

169
00:19:09,475 --> 00:19:10,635
Who do you work for?

170
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:13,402
Shit, we're dead.

171
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:16,080
I should ask you that question.

172
00:19:16,248 --> 00:19:18,409
I thought it was for the U.S.
government.

173
00:19:18,584 --> 00:19:20,245
Come on, Lee.

174
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,986
What do you think we do here?

175
00:19:23,422 --> 00:19:25,413
This isn't the Red Cross.

176
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:28,989
We make weapons.
Things that kill people.

177
00:19:29,495 --> 00:19:31,827
If the government won't pay the cost...

178
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:34,428
...it's my job to find someone who will.

179
00:19:35,834 --> 00:19:38,667
Treason is part of the
corporate strategy?

180
00:19:40,172 --> 00:19:42,606
I asked who you were working for.

181
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:44,340
You didn't tell me.

182
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,272
My God.

183
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:46,934
Holy shit.

184
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:52,011
Christ.

185
00:19:52,184 --> 00:19:53,845
Get her out of there.

186
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:57,177
What is this?

187
00:19:58,624 --> 00:20:00,182
A camera?

188
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,023
For the FBl, William.
They heard everything you just said.

189
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:11,125
They're watching us now.

190
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:16,199
And you think that makes you safe?

191
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:21,505
You...

192
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:24,209
...have no fucking idea!

193
00:20:25,717 --> 00:20:27,548
How could you do this to me?

194
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,987
I hope you understand, Lee.

195
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,655
You leave me no choice.

196
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:00,913
Wait a minute! Stop her!

197
00:21:02,521 --> 00:21:04,352
Stop! Hey!

198
00:21:08,694 --> 00:21:09,922
Go, go, go!

199
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:18,429
Hard evidence.

200
00:21:20,439 --> 00:21:22,202
It's all yours, gentlemen.

201
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:26,033
We've handled these situations before.

202
00:21:26,211 --> 00:21:28,202
You haven't answered my question.

203
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,109
We told you there'd be risks.

204
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:34,108
You told me I'd have complete
protection the entire time.

205
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:37,050
It didn't go as smoothly
as we anticipated.

206
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:38,780
That's an understatement.

207
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:41,551
Remember, Miss Cullen, you came to us.

208
00:21:41,727 --> 00:21:45,288
I came to you with a clerical error.
You asked for my help.

209
00:21:45,464 --> 00:21:46,795
And we got it.

210
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:50,401
If Cyrez sells weapons' technology,
that's high treason.

211
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:54,972
This disk and your testimony will put
all the co-conspirators behind bars.

212
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,904
You've done a great
service for your country.

213
00:21:58,577 --> 00:22:00,408
It's time to think about your safety.

214
00:22:08,587 --> 00:22:11,579
This is U.S. Marshal John Kruger,
Witness Protection Program.

215
00:22:11,757 --> 00:22:13,748
He'll handle your personal security.

216
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,824
My protection?

217
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,620
Your new identity, relocation.
I'll take you through it step-by-step.

218
00:22:20,766 --> 00:22:23,428
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.

219
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:26,831
You're in an extremely
high-risk situation.

220
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,498
Wasn't it explained to you?

221
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:33,775
Your boss was just a middleman, Lee.

222
00:22:33,946 --> 00:22:36,107
There are more dangerous
people involved.

223
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:39,773
You expect me to give up my whole life?

224
00:22:39,952 --> 00:22:43,183
Until the trial. Then you're
completely out of danger.

225
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:45,118
And how do you know that?

226
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,621
How do you know?

227
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:51,462
Look, I will keep up my end of
the bargain. I will testify.

228
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:53,295
But that's it.

229
00:22:54,366 --> 00:22:55,958
I'm going home.

230
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:03,971
Put people on her right away...

231
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,700
...or we'll need a seance
for her testimony.

232
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:09,143
Who brought her into this?

233
00:23:09,314 --> 00:23:12,306
She volunteered. She had
security clearance....

234
00:23:12,484 --> 00:23:14,475
You told her it's a walk in the park.

235
00:23:14,653 --> 00:23:18,145
When she finds out her life isn't
her own anymore, it's too late.

236
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:20,553
We had no case without her.

237
00:23:20,726 --> 00:23:24,492
It's easier to put her ass on
the line than yours, isn't it?

238
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:38,904
Sully.

239
00:23:39,077 --> 00:23:40,567
Frediano, how you doing?

240
00:23:40,746 --> 00:23:42,737
Good. Have something for you.

241
00:23:42,914 --> 00:23:43,903
Let's see.

242
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:51,244
Your receipt.

243
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:54,251
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.

244
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,222
It's me.

245
00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:32,392
Your music has arrived.

246
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,302
Get Mr. Morehart down here.

247
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:16,825
-It's me.
-Lee?

248
00:26:17,002 --> 00:26:19,402
I heard about Donahue. Are you okay?

249
00:26:19,571 --> 00:26:20,902
I'm fine.

250
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:24,671
-I shouldn't have trusted them.
-Of course not. The Feds are idiots.

251
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,504
They'll blow the case or bury it.

252
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:31,513
The Feds are here.

253
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,844
They're watching.

254
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:37,750
Let me write this story and I'll
nail Cyrez all over the front page.

255
00:26:37,923 --> 00:26:39,914
It may not be safe to
talk on this phone.

256
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,267
I'll call you.

257
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:51,925
Wait. Did you make a copy?

258
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:54,094
-Yeah.
-That's your insurance, Lee.

259
00:26:54,272 --> 00:26:56,706
Go public. They don't dare touch you.

260
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:02,436
Lee, what's wrong?

261
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:04,875
I don't know. I got to go.

262
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:12,051
Hi, baby.

263
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,880
What are you doing here?

264
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,391
Waiting for you. How are you doing?

265
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:19,121
So you just let yourself into my house?

266
00:27:19,297 --> 00:27:20,628
I've worried about you.

267
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:23,060
I haven't heard from you in days.

268
00:27:23,235 --> 00:27:25,897
There's nothing to talk about.
It's over.

269
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,231
You know that.

270
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,490
Come on.

271
00:27:49,661 --> 00:27:51,925
That doesn't hurt you to say that?

272
00:27:52,097 --> 00:27:53,655
It hurt me 3 months ago.

273
00:27:53,832 --> 00:27:58,269
But after the phone calls, after
the notes on my car, and tonight...

274
00:27:58,937 --> 00:28:00,768
...it's getting a lot easier.

275
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:24,521
Get down.

276
00:28:44,049 --> 00:28:45,209
Who're you seeing?

277
00:28:45,984 --> 00:28:47,542
Come on, Darryl.

278
00:28:47,719 --> 00:28:49,209
I know you're seeing someone.

279
00:28:51,823 --> 00:28:53,484
Let's see who that is.

280
00:28:57,562 --> 00:28:58,722
What's this?

281
00:28:58,997 --> 00:28:59,827
And a card.

282
00:28:59,998 --> 00:29:01,158
Get down!

283
00:29:08,907 --> 00:29:10,898
Oh, shit! Go, go, go!

284
00:29:23,254 --> 00:29:24,687
Come here!

285
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,759
Stay down.

286
00:29:41,106 --> 00:29:42,539
I don't have a shot.

287
00:30:10,301 --> 00:30:11,893
You, go, go.

288
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:41,829
-What are you doing?
-Lighting a fuse.

289
00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:46,060
Are you hit?

290
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:47,562
Are you bleeding?

291
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:49,158
I don't think so.

292
00:31:50,068 --> 00:31:52,662
-Are they following us?
-No. Just calm down.

293
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,031
You'll be fine.

294
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,934
I'm not fine.

295
00:31:56,107 --> 00:31:57,438
They tried to kill me!

296
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,999
Darryl's dead.

297
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:01,675
You're alive.

298
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:04,339
Keep you that way.

299
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:08,749
Your hand.

300
00:32:10,688 --> 00:32:13,020
There's a first aid kit under your seat.

301
00:32:16,594 --> 00:32:19,085
That weapon, or whatever it was...

302
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:21,027
...was from your company, wasn't it?

303
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,927
It's an E.M. prototype.

304
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:24,693
It's not supposed to exist.

305
00:32:24,869 --> 00:32:25,597
E.M.?

306
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,761
Electromagnetic pulse.

307
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:30,533
No gunpowder, no conventional bullets.

308
00:32:30,708 --> 00:32:33,438
They fire aluminum rounds at
almost the speed of light.

309
00:32:34,112 --> 00:32:35,443
A rail gun.

310
00:32:36,114 --> 00:32:38,105
Yeah, that's another name for them.

311
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:40,940
The Navy's worked on them for years.

312
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,213
The smallest one I've heard of
is mounted on a battleship.

313
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:47,455
Cyrez was contracted
to scale them down...

314
00:32:47,725 --> 00:32:50,455
...to design a compact
hypervelocity, pulse weapon...

315
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:52,960
...most powerful assault rifle on earth.

316
00:32:53,131 --> 00:32:55,793
They took millions, then
said it was impossible.

317
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:57,798
They looked real enough to me.

318
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:00,470
Maybe Cyrez found a higher bidder.

319
00:33:00,805 --> 00:33:04,798
They're connected everywhere:
Defense, CIA, NSA...

320
00:33:05,243 --> 00:33:07,143
...maybe even your people.

321
00:33:09,647 --> 00:33:11,137
Still want to put them away?

322
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:14,974
Yes.

323
00:33:16,421 --> 00:33:17,979
I'll hide you until the hearings.

324
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:21,981
No one will know where.
Not my boss, not WITSEC.

325
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,422
No one.

326
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:24,784
Can you do that?

327
00:33:24,996 --> 00:33:29,262
The Feds knew it'd be a death sentence
for you, and let you walk right into it.

328
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:31,599
I'm stupid.

329
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,502
You trusted them, that's all.

330
00:33:35,273 --> 00:33:36,604
Now, trust me.

331
00:33:51,189 --> 00:33:52,781
This is Morehart.

332
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,184
We have a problem.

333
00:33:55,193 --> 00:33:57,024
Go ahead. This line's secure.

334
00:33:58,963 --> 00:34:00,794
The Cullen woman is still alive.

335
00:34:00,965 --> 00:34:02,125
Are you serious?

336
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,858
It gets worse.

337
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:05,195
She has a disk.

338
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,132
She tried to access our program with it.

339
00:34:09,641 --> 00:34:13,543
Do you have any idea the risk
I took to get this back?!

340
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:16,202
I know. She must have made a duplicate.

341
00:34:16,814 --> 00:34:18,145
Then get it.

342
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:19,647
Whatever it takes!

343
00:34:19,817 --> 00:34:20,977
Understood.

344
00:34:22,553 --> 00:34:23,884
One other thing.

345
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:25,721
I checked her phone records.

346
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,879
And?

347
00:34:27,725 --> 00:34:30,319
She called a woman named lsaacs.

348
00:34:30,495 --> 00:34:32,827
A reporter for the Washington Herald.

349
00:34:35,667 --> 00:34:36,827
I see.

350
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,061
You know what has to be done.

351
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:42,662
Do it.

352
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,671
The Joint Chiefs are ready.

353
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:53,016
I'll be right there. Thank you.

354
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:20,109
That's it. That's everything I am.

355
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:21,942
That's nothing.

356
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:24,274
It's a few numbers and some plastic.

357
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:26,777
What you are is in here.

358
00:35:27,452 --> 00:35:30,046
No one can take that from you.

359
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:34,047
They'll try.

360
00:35:34,225 --> 00:35:35,886
We'll stop them.

361
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:43,894
I need the rest.

362
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:46,125
That's all.

363
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:47,965
No. This.

364
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:50,635
This?

365
00:35:56,748 --> 00:35:58,739
It's St. George.

366
00:36:00,985 --> 00:36:04,978
It's silly, but when I was a kid I
used to have nightmares about dragons.

367
00:36:05,823 --> 00:36:07,256
He watched over you.

368
00:36:07,425 --> 00:36:08,357
Yeah.

369
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,984
Well, that's my job now.

370
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,766
Get some sleep.

371
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:19,268
We leave at dawn.

372
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:21,097
Okay.

373
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:23,095
Night.

374
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:44,188
There's a place I know where
it's easy to disappear.

375
00:36:47,465 --> 00:36:49,695
There's a woman there I helped.

376
00:36:49,867 --> 00:36:53,200
She testified against the
yakuza bosses in San Francisco.

377
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:55,532
Her new name is Mei-Ling.

378
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,700
You'll be safe with
her until the hearings.

379
00:37:16,727 --> 00:37:18,558
Your new name is Deborah Elliott.

380
00:37:18,729 --> 00:37:21,220
You think of me as a "Deborah?"

381
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:23,061
I don't know.

382
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,996
I could have used
something more fun, like...

383
00:37:26,571 --> 00:37:27,731
...Debbie?

384
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:29,169
Deb?

385
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:30,863
Deborah's fine.

386
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,270
AAA credit.

387
00:37:33,177 --> 00:37:34,075
What's my limit?

388
00:37:34,245 --> 00:37:36,577
It is not a license to shop.

389
00:37:36,747 --> 00:37:38,578
I want you to lay low right now.

390
00:37:38,749 --> 00:37:40,239
Mei-Ling will take care of you.

391
00:37:42,019 --> 00:37:43,179
You know the signal.

392
00:37:43,421 --> 00:37:45,252
911 . Get out of the apartment.

393
00:37:45,423 --> 00:37:48,517
Go straight to the pay
phone and wait for my call.

394
00:37:48,693 --> 00:37:52,754
It's a public place, with
6 exits and 6 ways out.

395
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,088
And...

396
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:56,590
...l work alone.

397
00:37:56,767 --> 00:37:59,759
If anyone comes to you
and claims I sent them...

398
00:38:02,206 --> 00:38:03,366
...use this.

399
00:38:04,108 --> 00:38:05,939
You just pull the trigger.

400
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,044
I guess I won't see you again.

401
00:38:12,116 --> 00:38:14,209
If everything goes well...no.

402
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,553
At least not until the trial.

403
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,751
Thanks.

404
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,121
Thank me when it's over.

405
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,901
Undersecretary of Defense Daniel Harper...

406
00:38:41,078 --> 00:38:44,639
...spoke before Congress
today about the Cyrez scandal.

407
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:47,409
Private contractors are
within parameters...

408
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:50,076
...of Defense Department spending.

409
00:38:50,254 --> 00:38:54,088
I look forward to the Cyrez
hearing. I'm confident...

410
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:57,159
...we'll be vindicated of
mismanagement of funds.

411
00:38:57,762 --> 00:39:01,163
Thank you, Mr. Chairman,
for the opportunity.

412
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,476
Thanks for coming.

413
00:39:18,649 --> 00:39:21,311
You know I don't like
meeting outside of work.

414
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,316
It's not my choice.

415
00:39:23,487 --> 00:39:24,749
Are they with you?

416
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:28,250
Yeah.

417
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,995
Whether I like it or not....

418
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,326
Listen, John...

419
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,327
...we've got a problem.

420
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:41,998
What's up?

421
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,332
Someone's murdering our witnesses.

422
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,501
We've got 3 confirmed
kills in the last 48 hours.

423
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,271
-Who?
-Not one of yours.

424
00:39:50,448 --> 00:39:52,177
Not one of mine. Not yet.

425
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,284
-Did they break cover?
-No.

426
00:39:54,452 --> 00:39:56,352
No, that is the problem.

427
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:00,286
And there's no way anyone could
know all 3 of their locations.

428
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:06,359
There's a mole inside WITSEC.

429
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:09,121
Beller thinks so. He may be right.

430
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:14,129
All 3 singers were witnesses in
some high profile federal cases.

431
00:40:14,305 --> 00:40:18,036
All with international ties.
That's our common thread.

432
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:21,039
Other singers fit the profile.

433
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:22,201
Six.

434
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,974
One's yours and one's mine. So...

435
00:40:25,216 --> 00:40:27,980
...we have to replant them immediately.

436
00:40:28,152 --> 00:40:30,382
The jet is fueling as we speak.

437
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:32,313
I work alone.

438
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:33,645
You know that.

439
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:35,223
Not today.

440
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:36,826
Beller's orders.

441
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,495
Buddy system, CIA escorts...

442
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,827
...3 teams. We're one of them.

443
00:40:41,999 --> 00:40:43,159
Fine.

444
00:40:43,334 --> 00:40:44,995
We do yours first.

445
00:40:57,014 --> 00:40:58,572
This is John Kruger.

446
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:02,241
These are agents Schiff and Calderon.
I forgot which is which.

447
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,183
-I'm Schiff.
-And I'm Calderon.

448
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:05,515
Know her?

449
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:07,087
Should l?

450
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:11,024
She was reporting on Cyrez.
It could be connected to your witness.

451
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,028
Did someone take her out?

452
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:15,028
Peeled her like an onion.

453
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,258
If she knew anything, she talked.

454
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:22,931
This here is Deputy Monroe.
He's one of ours.

455
00:41:23,274 --> 00:41:26,710
Monroe, you're looking at
a legend: Mr. John Kruger.

456
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:28,936
-Deputy.
-Sir, it's a pleasure.

457
00:41:33,717 --> 00:41:35,207
Nice rig.

458
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,883
-How many of these you got?
-Three.

459
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,716
Different parts of the country.

460
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,623
Handy for quick relocates. Sometimes
we run violent felons for the Feds.

461
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,628
Chauffeurs for degenerates.

462
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,566
Don't you get tired of babysitting scum?

463
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:51,792
Yeah.

464
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,630
But in your case, we'll
make an exception.

465
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:02,703
Who the hell does he think he is?

466
00:42:04,081 --> 00:42:06,743
He thinks he's the best guy in the game.

467
00:42:06,917 --> 00:42:10,080
I think he's right.
Try not to piss him off.

468
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:39,514
You're east.

469
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:40,672
You're west.

470
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:42,443
You're north. Here.

471
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,282
We've got the boathouse,
garage, back door.

472
00:42:45,456 --> 00:42:46,480
Front entrance.

473
00:42:47,191 --> 00:42:48,453
You and me, buddy.

474
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,692
I don't want to get shot today.

475
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,625
Keep your safeties on.

476
00:42:53,797 --> 00:42:55,788
We'll find her inside baking muffins.

477
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,365
This is my witness.

478
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:00,629
Her name is Allison.
She's a very nice lady.

479
00:43:00,804 --> 00:43:02,795
So let's bring her out safely.

480
00:43:02,973 --> 00:43:03,962
Here you go.

481
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,538
Let's go, big guy.

482
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:23,655
The engine's still warm.

483
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:01,484
Shut up!

484
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:04,759
You're early.

485
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:05,656
You're late.

486
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:34,688
Hush, now.

487
00:45:37,194 --> 00:45:39,287
He won't hurt you anymore.

488
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,709
Get an ambulance!

489
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:56,471
Go on!

490
00:45:58,315 --> 00:45:59,873
Sorry, honey.

491
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:20,235
We lost her.

492
00:46:22,172 --> 00:46:24,663
Why send 5 men to kill one woman?

493
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:30,336
They were waiting for us.

494
00:46:30,748 --> 00:46:32,079
We've been set up.

495
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,281
Yours?

496
00:46:42,393 --> 00:46:43,291
Call her.

497
00:46:43,527 --> 00:46:45,927
No phones. We must live-contact her.

498
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,590
Where is she?

499
00:46:48,198 --> 00:46:49,426
Atlanta.

500
00:46:51,034 --> 00:46:52,695
Let's move, then.

501
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:10,880
Here. You'll like this better.

502
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:29,469
You all right?

503
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:33,065
I think so, sir.

504
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:35,142
First time under fire?

505
00:47:38,916 --> 00:47:40,747
It's okay to be shaky.

506
00:47:40,918 --> 00:47:42,647
Hell, I'm shaky.

507
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:46,080
The thing is, sir...

508
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:48,986
...l don't know what I feel.

509
00:47:49,426 --> 00:47:50,757
It was terrible and....

510
00:47:50,994 --> 00:47:53,485
Exciting at the same time?

511
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:59,497
Nothing to be ashamed of.
It's perfectly natural.

512
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,430
Tell him.

513
00:48:01,605 --> 00:48:02,469
It's natural.

514
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:12,679
The game's that way.

515
00:48:14,518 --> 00:48:18,181
Like a drug. You get hooked,
there's no turning back.

516
00:48:41,144 --> 00:48:42,805
Take me.

517
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:45,378
My old man...

518
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:48,311
...a little nobody in D.C.

519
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:51,048
Nice quiet guy.

520
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,713
Anyway, on his deathbed...

521
00:48:54,391 --> 00:48:58,657
...he tells me that all those
years he was working for the CIA.

522
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,497
I had to be part of that world.

523
00:49:01,665 --> 00:49:04,828
I joined the CIA, couple of years...
now I'm at WITSEC.

524
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:29,589
Hey, buddy.

525
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:33,686
What about you, sir?
Why did you join WITSEC?

526
00:49:36,934 --> 00:49:38,765
Sir, is something wrong?

527
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:40,759
Answer the kid.

528
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:42,599
Go ahead.

529
00:49:43,206 --> 00:49:44,264
Sir?

530
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:48,043
Come on.

531
00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:54,107
You.

532
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:10,065
What the hell is going on?

533
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,569
He cleared the numbers.

534
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:17,798
What the hell?!

535
00:50:17,975 --> 00:50:18,907
Quiet.

536
00:50:19,076 --> 00:50:20,976
Did you capture that call?

537
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,809
Got it. New York prefix.

538
00:50:30,921 --> 00:50:32,081
Taxi!

539
00:50:34,825 --> 00:50:35,814
City Zoo.

540
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,159
New York. Tell him to change course.

541
00:50:38,328 --> 00:50:41,092
-I'll call WITSEC.
-No, that won't be necessary.

542
00:50:41,264 --> 00:50:43,755
We must report flight plan changes.

543
00:50:43,934 --> 00:50:46,994
Monroe, you did great work
back there. Sit down.

544
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,262
Sit down.

545
00:50:49,439 --> 00:50:51,669
Did I give you your evaluation yet?

546
00:50:52,609 --> 00:50:53,598
Evaluation?

547
00:50:56,013 --> 00:50:57,503
A+, kid.

548
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:02,183
Damn it! Get me a
Wet-Nap or something!

549
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,180
Who's in New York?

550
00:51:04,454 --> 00:51:06,183
4 or 5 guys we can trust.

551
00:51:07,624 --> 00:51:08,613
Get them.

552
00:51:09,459 --> 00:51:10,949
Clean this mess up.

553
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:36,978
Confused?

554
00:51:38,655 --> 00:51:39,747
New York.

555
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:41,389
You're off course.

556
00:51:42,492 --> 00:51:44,323
No, we're not.

557
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:48,159
You'll take us to her.

558
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:57,333
You did a very, very bad thing.

559
00:51:58,842 --> 00:52:00,002
You killed Monroe.

560
00:52:04,347 --> 00:52:06,747
Now that makes you the mole.

561
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:11,245
That makes you a murderer.

562
00:52:13,356 --> 00:52:14,550
Easy, Big John.

563
00:52:18,528 --> 00:52:19,859
I'm a businessman.

564
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:25,698
A very, very serious businessman.

565
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:27,097
Businessman?

566
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,262
Selling weapons to your old CIA pals?

567
00:52:30,707 --> 00:52:32,368
Is it just the money?

568
00:52:32,542 --> 00:52:35,375
Trying to start your own dirty,
little war somewhere?

569
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:36,943
Wars?

570
00:52:37,547 --> 00:52:39,105
Wars, John?

571
00:52:39,716 --> 00:52:41,206
Wars come and go.

572
00:52:41,551 --> 00:52:43,781
We did Nam, we lost.

573
00:52:44,221 --> 00:52:45,950
We did the Gulf, we won.

574
00:52:46,623 --> 00:52:47,715
What changed?

575
00:52:48,225 --> 00:52:49,283
Nothing.

576
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:51,124
Nothing ever does.

577
00:52:51,728 --> 00:52:54,458
The only difference is who
gets rich and who gets dead.

578
00:52:54,631 --> 00:52:57,122
Personally, John, I prefer rich.

579
00:52:57,968 --> 00:53:00,129
You must be a very rich man by now.

580
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:02,132
It doesn't have to end like this.

581
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:04,630
I can make you part of it. A big part.

582
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:08,305
Just give up the girl. What do you say?

583
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:10,143
Drop your gun.

584
00:53:10,981 --> 00:53:11,970
What?

585
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:14,640
If you drop your gun now...

586
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:16,649
...l promise I won't kill you.

587
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,585
I'll have to take my chances.

588
00:53:50,954 --> 00:53:54,856
You nailed me with this cheap
piece of mail order shit!

589
00:54:07,637 --> 00:54:08,865
Think about it!

590
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:11,030
You jump, you'll go through
there like shit through a goose!

591
00:54:11,541 --> 00:54:12,530
You're right!

592
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:27,547
Engine fire!

593
00:55:51,074 --> 00:55:52,473
Turn this thing around!

594
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:54,906
I'm trying to keep us in the air!

595
00:55:55,078 --> 00:55:57,308
Turn it around and take him out!
Now!

596
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:18,496
I want his face all
over this windshield.

597
00:57:37,414 --> 00:57:39,746
Oh, man. Did that hurt?

598
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:42,213
It had to hurt. I saw it.

599
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,209
Where is this?

600
00:57:45,388 --> 00:57:46,286
Earth.

601
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:47,787
Welcome.

602
00:57:55,065 --> 00:57:56,965
Is that your daddy's truck?

603
00:57:58,468 --> 00:58:00,800
Think he'd mind if I borrow it?

604
00:58:01,571 --> 00:58:03,061
I don't know.

605
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:05,907
Is this yours?

606
00:58:08,311 --> 00:58:09,573
Like it?

607
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:10,768
Yeah.

608
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,742
What about a trade?

609
00:58:14,417 --> 00:58:16,078
50 bucks.

610
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,581
50 bucks?

611
00:58:32,902 --> 00:58:34,130
Shit.

612
00:58:34,904 --> 00:58:37,634
We traced her to Chinatown,
but she was long gone.

613
00:58:37,807 --> 00:58:40,139
No shit, Dick Tracy.
It was a run signal.

614
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,743
The cab companies?

615
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:45,472
Three pickups of solo women
within 15 minutes of the call.

616
00:58:45,915 --> 00:58:47,075
Drop-offs?

617
00:58:47,317 --> 00:58:50,411
Madison and 53rd.
89th and Central Park West.

618
00:58:50,587 --> 00:58:51,918
New York City Zoo.

619
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:53,486
-That's it.
-The zoo?

620
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:57,148
First a run signal, then straight
to a public meeting place.

621
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:59,158
-Your shooters?
-Standing by.

622
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:02,423
I want two teams to sweep
from the north and south.

623
00:59:04,334 --> 00:59:05,426
Go!

624
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:41,527
Ladies and gentlemen, the zoo
will be closing in 10 minutes.

625
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:44,104
Miss Cullen?

626
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:48,541
Ma'am, I'm here to help.
I'm a U.S. Marshal.

627
00:59:49,879 --> 00:59:51,210
Where's John Kruger?

628
00:59:51,814 --> 00:59:56,148
On his way. He sent me to be sure
you're safe until he gets here.

629
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:01,214
Really?

630
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,050
Then he showed you
the secret handshake?

631
01:00:11,334 --> 01:00:12,323
Shit!

632
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:14,537
DeGuerin!

633
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,231
The bitch just shot me!

634
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:24,176
We're on our way. Don't kill her.
Do you hear me?

635
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:28,642
What's going on?

636
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:30,909
U.S. Marshal. Close all exits.

637
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:32,179
People are inside.

638
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:33,913
Get them out, now!

639
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:35,580
Let's go.

640
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:37,420
You two, here.

641
01:00:37,594 --> 01:00:39,687
Everyone, please exit the zoo.

642
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:42,197
Let's go, immediately!

643
01:00:42,365 --> 01:00:44,697
Police emergency! Thank you!

644
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:03,941
Come on!

645
01:01:43,593 --> 01:01:44,924
He's here.

646
01:02:25,134 --> 01:02:26,533
Hold your fire!

647
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:27,533
Lee...

648
01:02:27,804 --> 01:02:29,863
...just drop your weapon.

649
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:42,212
Move!

650
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,652
-You're late!
-Traffic.

651
01:02:57,800 --> 01:02:59,893
-How's your ammo?
-I'm out.

652
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:02,333
Damn it! Two rounds left.

653
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,832
Move!

654
01:03:05,241 --> 01:03:06,731
Ready to go?

655
01:03:07,076 --> 01:03:10,239
Stay down. When I say
so, head for the door.

656
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,006
Go.

657
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,554
Let's go.

658
01:04:40,136 --> 01:04:41,899
You're luggage.

659
01:05:03,593 --> 01:05:05,083
How many casualties?

660
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:08,163
Three. Kruger took them
out like that, cold.

661
01:05:08,331 --> 01:05:11,323
-I can't believe this.
-His prints were on the weapon.

662
01:05:11,501 --> 01:05:14,163
Run prints on him? That's moving fast.

663
01:05:16,005 --> 01:05:17,438
I was there.

664
01:05:18,107 --> 01:05:20,439
Why would he do a thing like this?

665
01:05:20,676 --> 01:05:21,665
Look...

666
01:05:21,944 --> 01:05:26,176
...the man has nothing to keep
him honest. He's been bought.

667
01:05:27,116 --> 01:05:29,016
I've known John for years.

668
01:05:29,185 --> 01:05:30,015
We're losing time.

669
01:05:31,354 --> 01:05:33,515
If he's innocent, why's he on the run?

670
01:05:33,689 --> 01:05:34,747
And his witness?

671
01:05:35,258 --> 01:05:36,850
She's in it with him.

672
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:38,857
What the hell do you mean?

673
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:42,529
We identified ourselves.
She shot one of my men.

674
01:05:45,268 --> 01:05:46,633
Fine.

675
01:05:48,371 --> 01:05:50,703
Do whatever it takes to bring him in.

676
01:05:53,209 --> 01:05:53,971
But--

677
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,074
Sir?

678
01:05:56,879 --> 01:05:58,369
Bring him in alive.

679
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:08,217
Captain?

680
01:06:08,658 --> 01:06:10,558
Put out a citywide A.P.B.

681
01:06:10,726 --> 01:06:14,218
Lock this town up so tight
it'll make his balls ache.

682
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:40,317
Beller.

683
01:06:40,756 --> 01:06:42,747
-Captain.
-John, where are you?

684
01:06:42,925 --> 01:06:47,419
DeGuerin is the mole. He killed
the others to flush out my witness.

685
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:48,586
Come in.

686
01:06:48,764 --> 01:06:50,095
I'll protect my witness!

687
01:06:50,266 --> 01:06:53,030
You'll put her in danger.
You'll both end up dead.

688
01:06:53,202 --> 01:06:56,831
DeGuerin has been bought.
My witness knows too much.

689
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,769
Federal agents say you are the shooter.

690
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:04,276
I'll call you back.

691
01:07:04,447 --> 01:07:05,436
When?

692
01:07:05,615 --> 01:07:07,276
When I have proof.

693
01:07:15,858 --> 01:07:17,450
It's gone too far.

694
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:20,722
We're on our own.

695
01:07:21,297 --> 01:07:22,730
What can we do?

696
01:07:23,232 --> 01:07:25,632
We can't stay on the run for long.

697
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,470
We need hard evidence.

698
01:07:45,187 --> 01:07:47,018
You kept a copy?

699
01:07:47,323 --> 01:07:51,760
I was supposed to give it to
a friend of mine, a reporter.

700
01:07:52,094 --> 01:07:53,652
-She asked me--
-Claire lsaacs?

701
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,692
How do you know?

702
01:07:59,268 --> 01:08:00,758
She's dead.

703
01:08:00,903 --> 01:08:02,370
They killed her.

704
01:08:04,106 --> 01:08:06,006
How could they have known?

705
01:08:06,208 --> 01:08:08,301
-I didn't tell anyone.
-I know. It's not your fault.

706
01:08:08,644 --> 01:08:09,975
Maybe they tapped her phone.

707
01:08:10,146 --> 01:08:11,408
There's many ways....

708
01:08:13,416 --> 01:08:15,407
Everything's going to be all right.

709
01:08:15,618 --> 01:08:17,677
I was just trying to cover myself.

710
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:20,181
I didn't know who I can trust.

711
01:08:20,856 --> 01:08:22,847
Now, I'll get us both killed.

712
01:08:23,025 --> 01:08:23,787
No.

713
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:26,117
This may be all that keeps us alive.

714
01:08:26,295 --> 01:08:28,286
I don't even know what's on that.

715
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:29,625
We'll see.

716
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:33,367
It's completely hacker-proof.

717
01:08:33,803 --> 01:08:36,431
There's no way to run it outside Cyrez.

718
01:08:36,872 --> 01:08:39,033
Then we'll run it from the inside.

719
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:44,302
It's like a fortress. We can't go
back there. They'd expect that.

720
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:47,812
I'd hate to disappoint them.

721
01:08:49,952 --> 01:08:54,218
The streets are clear. The police
are safely back in their donut shops.

722
01:08:55,658 --> 01:08:57,216
This is Father Rodriguez.

723
01:08:57,893 --> 01:08:58,951
Pleasure.

724
01:08:59,228 --> 01:09:01,458
I was not always Father Rodriguez.

725
01:09:01,664 --> 01:09:04,963
I was born again, with a
little help from our friend.

726
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:09,565
His Columbian associates wanted to
introduce him to God personally.

727
01:09:10,072 --> 01:09:12,165
I've been given a second chance at life.

728
01:09:12,341 --> 01:09:14,832
This time, I'm using it for God's work.

729
01:09:15,244 --> 01:09:16,734
Anything else I can do?

730
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:19,479
We need a car. Just for a day or two.

731
01:09:20,082 --> 01:09:21,071
Done.

732
01:09:21,183 --> 01:09:24,277
It burns as much oil as
gas, but it's yours.

733
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:33,089
You sure about this?

734
01:09:34,263 --> 01:09:36,254
There's no one else I can trust.

735
01:09:56,218 --> 01:10:00,712
It's raining men,
Hallelujah it's raining men

736
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,309
Hello, Johnny.

737
01:10:23,412 --> 01:10:24,242
Yo!

738
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,313
I need to talk to you right away.

739
01:10:31,153 --> 01:10:32,916
I've got one question.

740
01:10:33,055 --> 01:10:36,320
Was it your idea to hook me up
with the Village People here?

741
01:10:36,492 --> 01:10:37,925
You're safe?

742
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:40,051
From the mob, yeah.

743
01:10:40,663 --> 01:10:44,759
No self-respecting wiseguy would be
caught dead in a joint like this.

744
01:10:44,934 --> 01:10:47,266
Do me just one favor.

745
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:51,666
Don't let on that I'm straight.
I don't want to break any hearts.

746
01:10:51,941 --> 01:10:52,930
Trust me.

747
01:10:53,075 --> 01:10:56,670
You said if I ever need anything,
I could come to you?

748
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:58,177
I need your help.

749
01:10:58,948 --> 01:11:00,848
Wait. You need my help?

750
01:11:02,451 --> 01:11:03,179
Now.

751
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:04,942
You got it.

752
01:11:05,087 --> 01:11:08,454
Cover me for a few seconds.
I got to help a friend.

753
01:11:08,691 --> 01:11:11,182
Who's he? He looks rough!

754
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:12,793
Don't start.

755
01:11:12,962 --> 01:11:15,089
Do you two need a moment alone?

756
01:11:16,799 --> 01:11:18,357
We're fine, thanks.

757
01:11:18,701 --> 01:11:20,191
Just an idea.

758
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:22,960
Kevin just...worries about me.

759
01:11:24,373 --> 01:11:25,601
Don't ask.

760
01:11:29,311 --> 01:11:31,973
You want me to help
you break into Cyrez?

761
01:11:32,114 --> 01:11:32,978
Yeah.

762
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:34,480
You shitting me?

763
01:11:34,617 --> 01:11:37,313
I thought I'd help you
move a sofa or something.

764
01:11:37,486 --> 01:11:39,044
Pull over up ahead.

765
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:42,215
I'll help you out.

766
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:46,122
All we need is some tanks,
a few rocket launchers...

767
01:11:46,495 --> 01:11:50,226
...and a set of balls
like the King of Bayonne.

768
01:11:50,499 --> 01:11:51,625
You need these.

769
01:11:55,237 --> 01:11:56,829
I'll meet you at his place.

770
01:12:01,243 --> 01:12:03,074
I look like I've got gas?

771
01:12:26,669 --> 01:12:27,397
Gentlemen.

772
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:29,264
What's going on?

773
01:12:29,672 --> 01:12:31,663
It will be contained in 24 hours.

774
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:33,171
Not good enough.

775
01:12:34,109 --> 01:12:36,543
We have problems. They're solvable.

776
01:12:37,046 --> 01:12:38,536
We must cancel the shipment.

777
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:39,771
Not an option.

778
01:12:39,949 --> 01:12:44,181
What do we do with 10 tons of assault
weapons that's not supposed to exist.

779
01:12:44,386 --> 01:12:47,048
I am the eyes and ears of your world.

780
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:48,884
There's too much heat.

781
01:12:49,058 --> 01:12:50,389
You don't get it.

782
01:12:50,559 --> 01:12:52,550
The money has changed hands.

783
01:12:52,695 --> 01:12:55,892
These are not the kind
of people you cancel on.

784
01:13:00,803 --> 01:13:03,704
Get those guns out of the
country tonight or you're dead.

785
01:13:05,708 --> 01:13:06,697
Now...

786
01:13:07,142 --> 01:13:09,633
...how will you contain the situation?

787
01:13:09,912 --> 01:13:12,813
Kruger has to show up at Cyrez.
I'll be waiting.

788
01:13:12,982 --> 01:13:14,313
Why would he risk it?

789
01:13:14,483 --> 01:13:18,977
The disk is the only thing
that'll clear him and the woman.

790
01:13:19,154 --> 01:13:20,587
This better work.

791
01:13:20,723 --> 01:13:23,590
The disk. The girl. The guns.

792
01:13:23,726 --> 01:13:25,990
By dawn, they don't exist. Clear?

793
01:13:26,662 --> 01:13:27,651
Yeah.

794
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:29,161
Crystal.

795
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:33,435
In 2 weeks, the House Armed
Services Committee announced...

796
01:13:33,602 --> 01:13:36,935
...it will begin official
hearings into the Cyrez scandal.

797
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:42,672
It's crawling with reporters.
We've got to keep a lid on this mess.

798
01:13:42,845 --> 01:13:47,612
By tomorrow you'll be chuckling about
this in your kiss-ass country club.

799
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,240
Who's running this camera?

800
01:13:49,451 --> 01:13:50,509
I am.

801
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:53,113
This is Haggerty, head of security.

802
01:13:53,255 --> 01:13:54,244
Good.

803
01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,250
We'll keep everything
nice and low-profile?

804
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:00,025
Ever do any wetwork?

805
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:02,026
On 3 different continents.

806
01:14:02,197 --> 01:14:05,189
To impress me, Slick,
do your fucking job.

807
01:14:05,367 --> 01:14:07,028
How many people do you have?

808
01:14:07,202 --> 01:14:10,262
12 professionals.
They'll do what it takes.

809
01:14:10,472 --> 01:14:14,203
Plus 20 more on the security
force, who'll follow orders.

810
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:15,468
Fine.

811
01:14:15,644 --> 01:14:19,478
Make sure my man has
your full cooperation.

812
01:14:19,648 --> 01:14:23,277
We've got every possible
point-of-entry under surveillance...

813
01:14:23,485 --> 01:14:25,385
...from the rooftop to the sewers.

814
01:14:25,554 --> 01:14:26,714
He's a ghost.

815
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:30,655
If he wants in, he'll get in.
Where's he go to run this disk?

816
01:14:30,793 --> 01:14:33,660
The central vault.
No other terminal can access it.

817
01:14:34,163 --> 01:14:37,223
To read the disk,
there's only one way in.

818
01:14:38,567 --> 01:14:40,501
Outstanding, gentlemen.

819
01:14:41,003 --> 01:14:45,235
All we do is sit back and wait
for Mr. Kruger to come to us.

820
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,172
Where are you going?

821
01:14:53,315 --> 01:14:57,308
Take it easy. I've got a
delivery for Blevens, 14th floor.

822
01:14:57,519 --> 01:14:59,578
We can't accept any deliveries.

823
01:14:59,755 --> 01:15:01,746
"We can't accept any deliveries."

824
01:15:02,191 --> 01:15:04,182
I'm just messing with you, man.

825
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:08,089
Call Blevens to authorize it.
Pepperoni and cheese.

826
01:15:09,031 --> 01:15:11,329
Maybe you don't understand.

827
01:15:11,533 --> 01:15:13,694
This is a high-security facility.

828
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:18,339
You don't understand.
This is a Papa Genoche's pizza.

829
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:22,533
If he doesn't get it while it's still
hot, he gets two free out of my pocket!

830
01:15:22,711 --> 01:15:24,702
-I'm trying to save for a computer.
-Search him.

831
01:15:24,847 --> 01:15:26,542
Get your hands off me!

832
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,612
Listen...

833
01:15:29,852 --> 01:15:32,286
...l got a bad heart and a good lawyer.

834
01:15:32,454 --> 01:15:33,443
Shut up.

835
01:15:34,456 --> 01:15:35,616
He's clean.

836
01:15:38,293 --> 01:15:39,726
Cheese and pepperoni.

837
01:15:45,634 --> 01:15:47,124
Pal, hit the road.

838
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:48,563
I said, go!

839
01:15:59,481 --> 01:16:01,073
What's going on?

840
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,083
Pizza delivery guy is having a seizure.

841
01:16:04,253 --> 01:16:05,743
Who ordered a pizza?

842
01:16:05,888 --> 01:16:09,483
This is all we need. Get him
to the infirmary immediately.

843
01:16:31,813 --> 01:16:34,680
-How're we doing?
-We'll be on the road in an hour.

844
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:37,010
They roll or I need to know why.

845
01:16:37,186 --> 01:16:38,244
Yes, sir.

846
01:16:38,687 --> 01:16:40,678
Come on! Let's move it!

847
01:16:44,693 --> 01:16:45,921
You're expected.

848
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:49,090
Infirmary is through the loading dock.

849
01:16:49,264 --> 01:16:50,253
Patient stable?

850
01:16:50,432 --> 01:16:51,763
I'm not sure. Hurry.

851
01:16:51,934 --> 01:16:53,026
Thank you.

852
01:17:10,219 --> 01:17:12,710
He looks stable. Give him some oxygen.

853
01:17:21,463 --> 01:17:23,226
He's fibrillating! Code blue!

854
01:17:23,465 --> 01:17:25,057
No, it's okay!

855
01:17:29,972 --> 01:17:30,870
Gel.

856
01:17:34,142 --> 01:17:35,302
Clear!

857
01:17:38,747 --> 01:17:40,874
This way. They're waiting for you.

858
01:17:41,984 --> 01:17:44,077
Here we go again. Clear!

859
01:17:46,989 --> 01:17:48,251
Increase voltage.

860
01:17:50,592 --> 01:17:52,583
Let's do it one more time.

861
01:17:53,662 --> 01:17:54,594
Let's not.

862
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:58,595
You, over there, against the wall.

863
01:17:58,767 --> 01:17:59,995
On the floor.

864
01:18:00,502 --> 01:18:01,833
Face the wall.

865
01:18:03,005 --> 01:18:03,994
On the floor.

866
01:18:04,172 --> 01:18:05,503
My God! Terrorists!

867
01:18:05,674 --> 01:18:07,164
You want terror?

868
01:18:07,843 --> 01:18:10,334
You want some fricking terror?!

869
01:18:10,512 --> 01:18:12,104
I'll jump-start your ass!

870
01:18:12,281 --> 01:18:13,111
Tape them.

871
01:18:14,116 --> 01:18:15,276
Face the wall!

872
01:18:18,687 --> 01:18:19,779
Keep it secure.

873
01:18:21,423 --> 01:18:22,617
Handle that?

874
01:18:22,924 --> 01:18:23,913
Get out!

875
01:18:27,362 --> 01:18:28,522
Let's go.

876
01:18:36,138 --> 01:18:37,366
We have a problem.

877
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:39,038
What is it?

878
01:18:40,142 --> 01:18:42,201
-He's running the disk.
-Shit!

879
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:43,537
Impossible.

880
01:18:43,712 --> 01:18:46,044
Any activity at Station 1?

881
01:18:46,214 --> 01:18:47,545
All clear.

882
01:18:47,716 --> 01:18:50,810
My ass! He's in.
He just didn't use the door.

883
01:18:50,952 --> 01:18:53,216
Get your men down there, now! Go!

884
01:19:15,477 --> 01:19:17,968
-What are you doing?
-No, I know this.

885
01:19:18,180 --> 01:19:19,078
It changes.

886
01:19:19,247 --> 01:19:21,738
Screw that. Get out of the way.

887
01:19:24,986 --> 01:19:26,078
Check it.

888
01:19:43,372 --> 01:19:44,930
Somebody talk to me.

889
01:19:45,107 --> 01:19:48,508
He's at a remote terminal
somewhere in the building.

890
01:19:51,513 --> 01:19:53,447
-You said he couldn't.
-He can't.

891
01:19:53,715 --> 01:19:56,445
Donahue designed it so
no outside activity--

892
01:19:56,618 --> 01:19:58,108
Donahue is dead.

893
01:19:58,954 --> 01:20:02,788
You'll wish you were too, if you
don't find out what's going on...

894
01:20:02,958 --> 01:20:04,949
...and you find out now.

895
01:20:05,127 --> 01:20:06,958
-Holster it.
-Take a hike, junior.

896
01:20:07,462 --> 01:20:09,453
I said, holster your--

897
01:20:14,136 --> 01:20:18,800
Some people take things for granted,
like the ability to chew solid food.

898
01:20:19,141 --> 01:20:20,130
I'll find him.

899
01:20:22,544 --> 01:20:23,533
How?

900
01:20:23,979 --> 01:20:27,312
I'll scan the terminals,
eliminate them one by one.

901
01:20:27,482 --> 01:20:29,746
If he stays on-line, I'll nail him.

902
01:20:30,419 --> 01:20:31,408
Do it.

903
01:20:33,422 --> 01:20:34,480
How we doing?

904
01:20:34,990 --> 01:20:38,323
You were right. Donahue
left himself a back door.

905
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,755
But we still have to break his code.

906
01:20:43,165 --> 01:20:46,999
We've got another 5 or 6
minutes until they trace us.

907
01:20:49,337 --> 01:20:50,668
Recognize this?

908
01:20:50,839 --> 01:20:51,498
No.

909
01:20:51,673 --> 01:20:54,005
Warmer. It's an accounting format.

910
01:20:54,176 --> 01:20:56,508
Stop me if I get lucky.

911
01:20:59,347 --> 01:21:00,177
How we doing?

912
01:21:00,348 --> 01:21:02,179
Eliminating low clearance programs.

913
01:21:02,584 --> 01:21:04,279
South wing is clean.

914
01:21:04,453 --> 01:21:05,511
Two to go.

915
01:21:05,687 --> 01:21:08,520
Two federal investigators
downstairs want to talk.

916
01:21:09,524 --> 01:21:12,459
Do what you've got to do,
but get rid of them.

917
01:21:12,594 --> 01:21:15,028
-You can't be seen here.
-I won't be. Go.

918
01:21:17,466 --> 01:21:19,696
I need a chopper on the roof.

919
01:21:19,868 --> 01:21:20,800
Right.

920
01:21:22,537 --> 01:21:24,368
Those are offshore banking deposits.

921
01:21:24,806 --> 01:21:27,297
"UBS." That's Union de Banques Suisses.

922
01:21:27,476 --> 01:21:29,376
$52 million.

923
01:21:30,378 --> 01:21:32,972
If it's an arms sale, it's a major one.

924
01:21:33,114 --> 01:21:34,877
Let's see who their buyer is.

925
01:21:38,053 --> 01:21:39,213
"Sergei...

926
01:21:39,387 --> 01:21:41,378
...lvanovich Petrofsky."

927
01:21:41,756 --> 01:21:42,745
Who's that?

928
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:44,317
Bad news.

929
01:21:45,627 --> 01:21:47,492
Head of a cartel in the Russian Mafia...

930
01:21:48,063 --> 01:21:51,999
...selling drugs, guns and
influence to very unpleasant people.

931
01:21:56,905 --> 01:21:58,338
He's in the north wing.

932
01:21:58,507 --> 01:21:59,633
Get moving.

933
01:22:00,242 --> 01:22:01,402
Let's go.

934
01:22:02,344 --> 01:22:03,641
-How long?
-I don't know.

935
01:22:03,845 --> 01:22:06,643
15 terminals are
running secure programs.

936
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:11,842
You got 5 minutes.
Find them and call me.

937
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,351
Let's go.

938
01:22:15,524 --> 01:22:17,515
There it is. Delivery date...

939
01:22:18,426 --> 01:22:20,018
...tonight, midnight.

940
01:22:20,161 --> 01:22:22,425
1,000 units to Baltimore Harbor.

941
01:22:22,597 --> 01:22:24,087
1,000 units of what?

942
01:22:31,373 --> 01:22:33,603
1,000 E.M. guns.

943
01:22:34,109 --> 01:22:37,272
Are they insane?
lf these get offshore....

944
01:22:37,612 --> 01:22:40,672
There will be a whole new
era of world terrorism.

945
01:22:45,887 --> 01:22:48,879
Got him. 25th floor, Donahue's office.

946
01:22:49,057 --> 01:22:51,685
Scramble. Alpha Chief
to the north wing, now!

947
01:22:54,396 --> 01:22:55,624
They're onto us.

948
01:22:56,965 --> 01:22:58,956
They're erasing the goddamn disk.

949
01:23:37,672 --> 01:23:38,604
Come on!

950
01:23:51,753 --> 01:23:54,449
I'll cover you.
Meet me at the ambulance.

951
01:23:54,623 --> 01:23:55,681
Go!

952
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:09,459
Lee, run!

953
01:24:21,783 --> 01:24:23,148
Listen, John!

954
01:24:23,284 --> 01:24:24,683
My rules!

955
01:24:25,787 --> 01:24:29,223
Mess with me, I'll mail her
back to you in little pieces.

956
01:24:44,673 --> 01:24:45,799
Fire alert.

957
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:46,905
Fire Alert.

958
01:24:47,308 --> 01:24:51,301
This is not a drill. Please
proceed to the nearest exit.

959
01:25:23,778 --> 01:25:26,770
In this car I can get us to
Baltimore in 40 minutes.

960
01:25:26,948 --> 01:25:29,041
You're not coming with me.

961
01:25:29,284 --> 01:25:31,047
I'll drop you off.

962
01:25:31,219 --> 01:25:33,551
Don't give me this, "I work alone" shit.

963
01:25:33,722 --> 01:25:36,953
You've already done enough.
This is not your fight.

964
01:25:37,292 --> 01:25:40,784
Look, just indulge me
for a minute, okay?

965
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:42,790
If it weren't for you...

966
01:25:42,964 --> 01:25:46,866
...my tongue would be hanging
on Canelli's trophy wall.

967
01:25:47,469 --> 01:25:49,460
Look, you need me.

968
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:53,367
My cousin Tony runs those docks.

969
01:25:53,575 --> 01:25:56,237
If your ship is there, he will find it.

970
01:26:21,102 --> 01:26:22,660
You're short one envelope.

971
01:26:22,837 --> 01:26:24,600
Infantino didn't pay.

972
01:26:25,006 --> 01:26:26,906
What do you mean, didn't pay?

973
01:26:27,642 --> 01:26:28,700
What'd he say?

974
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:31,674
He said, "Tell that fat
fuck Tony Two-toes...

975
01:26:31,846 --> 01:26:33,837
...l ain't paying him another dime."

976
01:26:34,682 --> 01:26:36,343
I know that voice.

977
01:26:36,618 --> 01:26:38,176
But it can't be him.

978
01:26:40,188 --> 01:26:42,122
Not unless he's a ghost.

979
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,020
Boo.

980
01:26:47,695 --> 01:26:49,185
Johnny C. !

981
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,397
You got whacked!

982
01:26:52,133 --> 01:26:54,033
Must have been another guy.

983
01:26:54,803 --> 01:26:57,363
Another guy rat out Canelli too?

984
01:26:57,539 --> 01:26:59,370
Canelli's a piece of shit.

985
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:01,941
I got no love for Canelli, either.

986
01:27:03,144 --> 01:27:04,202
But...

987
01:27:06,447 --> 01:27:08,813
...this time you went over the line.

988
01:27:10,318 --> 01:27:11,444
I'm still here.

989
01:27:12,654 --> 01:27:14,884
What you did was wrong.

990
01:27:15,056 --> 01:27:18,548
He got a drug dealer and
his poison off the streets.

991
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:22,029
Whose the tree trunk?

992
01:27:23,064 --> 01:27:25,225
This is the guy who saved my ass.

993
01:27:25,567 --> 01:27:27,159
My cousin, Tony Two-toes.

994
01:27:27,735 --> 01:27:28,429
That's Sal.

995
01:27:30,738 --> 01:27:32,171
Little Mike.

996
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:34,672
Your funeral was absolutely beautiful.

997
01:27:35,343 --> 01:27:37,675
Canelli finds out he's still breathing--

998
01:27:37,846 --> 01:27:41,247
Screw Canelli. We got
bigger problems. Tell him.

999
01:27:41,416 --> 01:27:43,247
There's a major arms deal going down.

1000
01:27:43,918 --> 01:27:47,081
A U.S. contractor's selling out
to international terrorists.

1001
01:27:52,493 --> 01:27:56,088
Mr. 60 Minutes. Tell me
something I don't know.

1002
01:27:56,264 --> 01:27:58,926
It will happen tonight on your docks.

1003
01:28:01,202 --> 01:28:03,193
That I didn't know.

1004
01:28:08,877 --> 01:28:10,606
Quite a lot of security.

1005
01:28:11,112 --> 01:28:12,511
Expecting trouble?

1006
01:28:13,615 --> 01:28:15,708
I'm a Boy Scout. Always be prepared.

1007
01:28:15,884 --> 01:28:17,112
Why's she here?

1008
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:21,282
Just think of her as
an insurance policy...

1009
01:28:21,522 --> 01:28:24,013
...if someone crashes the party.

1010
01:28:24,626 --> 01:28:26,457
You're not telling me something.

1011
01:28:26,628 --> 01:28:30,029
Just a bump in the carpet.
Nothing for you to worry about.

1012
01:28:31,299 --> 01:28:34,029
Relax. You'll be out
of here in 20 minutes.

1013
01:28:34,969 --> 01:28:36,402
What about her?

1014
01:28:37,639 --> 01:28:38,970
Whatever.

1015
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:42,041
Once you're in international
waters, her policy expires.

1016
01:28:42,243 --> 01:28:43,540
Personally...

1017
01:28:43,978 --> 01:28:46,742
...l'd shoot her and
throw her overboard.

1018
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,640
It would be such a shame.

1019
01:28:50,919 --> 01:28:52,750
Don't even think about it.

1020
01:28:56,557 --> 01:29:00,550
I think and do what I like.
You will soon learn about this.

1021
01:29:02,330 --> 01:29:03,922
Last crate's on its way.

1022
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:06,991
I'll leave you lovebirds alone.

1023
01:29:10,838 --> 01:29:11,827
DeGuerin....

1024
01:29:22,583 --> 01:29:24,676
This is Kruger. Get me Beller.

1025
01:29:25,853 --> 01:29:27,684
Start a trace on this.

1026
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,191
I've got proof Cyrez is selling
weapons on the black market.

1027
01:29:36,364 --> 01:29:37,854
Daniel Harper's in on it.

1028
01:29:38,032 --> 01:29:40,296
Undersecretary of Defense Harper?

1029
01:29:40,468 --> 01:29:42,868
Yes. DeGuerin is their facilitator.

1030
01:29:43,037 --> 01:29:45,369
He is the mole.
It all goes down tonight.

1031
01:29:45,873 --> 01:29:48,364
Come and get me. Baltimore docks.

1032
01:29:48,543 --> 01:29:50,204
Pier 57.

1033
01:30:14,335 --> 01:30:15,324
Report.

1034
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:17,401
Range is clear.

1035
01:30:17,572 --> 01:30:19,005
Not a creature is stirring.

1036
01:30:23,911 --> 01:30:25,640
Clear on the south.

1037
01:30:27,248 --> 01:30:28,738
Quiet on the east.

1038
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:31,514
Listen up. This is the last load.

1039
01:30:31,652 --> 01:30:34,519
Keep your heads up and
your assholes puckered.

1040
01:30:34,756 --> 01:30:36,917
If he's out there, I want him.

1041
01:30:42,030 --> 01:30:42,860
Sunshine....

1042
01:30:44,098 --> 01:30:45,929
I want to talk to you.

1043
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,159
This is a restricted area.

1044
01:30:48,369 --> 01:30:52,100
You're telling me.
What the hell are you doing here?

1045
01:30:52,306 --> 01:30:53,273
Excuse me?

1046
01:30:53,441 --> 01:30:55,773
We're from Local 129, sonny.

1047
01:30:55,943 --> 01:31:00,778
We heard you was loading a ship without
assistance of bona fide union labor.

1048
01:31:00,948 --> 01:31:02,438
Say it ain't so.

1049
01:31:03,184 --> 01:31:04,776
Sir, we have a situation.

1050
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:06,609
You certainly do.

1051
01:31:06,788 --> 01:31:08,779
Stand by. We're coming to you.

1052
01:31:16,964 --> 01:31:18,397
What is it?

1053
01:31:18,566 --> 01:31:20,625
I'll explain something to you.

1054
01:31:20,802 --> 01:31:25,136
Nothing moves off these docks without
it don't get loaded by the union.

1055
01:31:25,473 --> 01:31:28,203
I don't see no union people around here.

1056
01:31:28,409 --> 01:31:29,205
Do you?

1057
01:31:29,410 --> 01:31:33,642
This is a matter of national security.
Clear this area immediately!

1058
01:31:33,815 --> 01:31:35,214
That's a threat?

1059
01:31:35,416 --> 01:31:37,077
Absolutely.

1060
01:31:51,232 --> 01:31:52,324
What was that?

1061
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,933
Gunfire at the warehouse!

1062
01:32:00,842 --> 01:32:03,174
Nobody screws with the union.

1063
01:32:09,117 --> 01:32:10,607
Perimeter, check in.

1064
01:32:11,018 --> 01:32:12,451
Talk to me!

1065
01:32:12,620 --> 01:32:14,178
We have a security breach.

1066
01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:16,516
Check it out! Get that crane moving!

1067
01:33:11,913 --> 01:33:14,507
Movement in the southwest corner.

1068
01:33:17,018 --> 01:33:17,882
It's nothing.

1069
01:33:25,426 --> 01:33:26,916
There they are.

1070
01:33:27,428 --> 01:33:28,759
Commie bastards.

1071
01:33:28,930 --> 01:33:33,765
Not Communists. They're a federation
of independent liberated states.

1072
01:33:33,935 --> 01:33:36,199
Don't make me hurt you, Mikey.

1073
01:33:36,337 --> 01:33:38,532
Keep your eyes on that crane.

1074
01:33:38,706 --> 01:33:40,230
Can I hit that guy from here?

1075
01:33:43,844 --> 01:33:47,439
You're lucky if you hit the
floor if you fell on it.

1076
01:33:52,653 --> 01:33:53,483
Got him.

1077
01:33:53,654 --> 01:33:54,552
30 yards.

1078
01:33:54,722 --> 01:33:55,711
Fry the bastard.

1079
01:34:03,764 --> 01:34:05,095
Jesus Christ.

1080
01:34:25,486 --> 01:34:27,147
Fuck me!

1081
01:34:31,892 --> 01:34:33,587
I think we got him!

1082
01:34:33,761 --> 01:34:35,251
He's toast!

1083
01:34:35,997 --> 01:34:37,658
I think we even got the roaches.

1084
01:34:38,099 --> 01:34:40,158
Royce, Somes, you're recon.

1085
01:34:40,334 --> 01:34:42,325
Bring me back the good news.

1086
01:34:42,503 --> 01:34:44,164
E.M. team, cover them.

1087
01:34:44,672 --> 01:34:45,832
Roger.

1088
01:35:17,705 --> 01:35:19,434
Come on, goddamn it.

1089
01:35:50,905 --> 01:35:52,736
Nice shotgun, asshole.

1090
01:37:30,070 --> 01:37:31,833
Schiff! Calderon!

1091
01:37:34,341 --> 01:37:35,740
They missed.

1092
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:40,171
Johnny?

1093
01:37:40,514 --> 01:37:42,175
I'll be right out.

1094
01:37:45,019 --> 01:37:46,418
Open fire!

1095
01:38:02,102 --> 01:38:04,195
It looks as if your friend has arrived.

1096
01:38:04,371 --> 01:38:06,430
I'll enjoy introducing him to you.

1097
01:38:06,607 --> 01:38:10,941
I won't have the pleasure.
He's forced me to hasten our departure.

1098
01:38:11,946 --> 01:38:13,379
And yours.

1099
01:39:36,363 --> 01:39:37,694
Goddamn it!

1100
01:39:37,865 --> 01:39:39,958
Now you are pissing me off!

1101
01:39:42,036 --> 01:39:43,196
Drop the guns.

1102
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,870
Now.

1103
01:39:57,051 --> 01:39:58,211
Thanks.

1104
01:39:59,653 --> 01:40:00,642
Shut up!

1105
01:40:02,389 --> 01:40:04,323
Take it up! Now!

1106
01:42:12,853 --> 01:42:14,844
Here. Grab the ladder.

1107
01:42:21,462 --> 01:42:22,326
Hold on.

1108
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:25,689
Say good-bye, John.

1109
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:30,698
Good-bye.

1110
01:43:15,415 --> 01:43:16,905
John, buddy!

1111
01:43:18,752 --> 01:43:20,413
Don't let me go like this.

1112
01:43:22,189 --> 01:43:23,679
Help me!

1113
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:40,866
Son-of-a-bitch!

1114
01:43:43,944 --> 01:43:45,104
Drop the gun!

1115
01:44:21,815 --> 01:44:23,248
Get him out!

1116
01:44:35,262 --> 01:44:36,661
Thank you, John.

1117
01:44:42,402 --> 01:44:43,130
Ready?

1118
01:44:43,303 --> 01:44:44,668
Let's go!

1119
01:45:17,871 --> 01:45:20,965
How does it feel to be
indicted for treason?

1120
01:45:21,141 --> 01:45:22,472
No comment.

1121
01:45:22,643 --> 01:45:25,544
Marshal DeGuerin! What about you?

1122
01:45:25,979 --> 01:45:27,207
I'm proud.

1123
01:45:27,381 --> 01:45:28,370
Of treason?

1124
01:45:28,982 --> 01:45:30,813
Of my patriotism.

1125
01:45:31,718 --> 01:45:33,879
Our actions stopped a secret alliance...

1126
01:45:34,054 --> 01:45:37,649
...this administration has had
with some of our worst enemies.

1127
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:40,991
The public deserves to know the truth.

1128
01:45:41,161 --> 01:45:43,220
When we're in court, they will.

1129
01:45:47,501 --> 01:45:49,162
They could get away with this.

1130
01:45:49,336 --> 01:45:51,236
If Morehart takes the fall.

1131
01:45:54,408 --> 01:45:55,841
You did well.

1132
01:45:57,577 --> 01:46:00,171
I couldn't have done it without you.

1133
01:46:02,349 --> 01:46:03,748
Ready?

1134
01:46:12,526 --> 01:46:14,426
Pretty impressive speech.

1135
01:46:15,028 --> 01:46:18,088
Learn to keep your mouth
shut in front of the press.

1136
01:46:18,765 --> 01:46:20,528
Doesn't matter, anyway.

1137
01:46:22,869 --> 01:46:25,429
It'll never go to trial without her.

1138
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,490
I'm not sure we should start again.

1139
01:47:22,662 --> 01:47:23,390
Why not?

1140
01:47:23,597 --> 01:47:27,158
With the bitch gone, we'll
spin doctor ourselves clean.

1141
01:47:27,334 --> 01:47:30,497
What if she's told her
friends, her family?

1142
01:47:30,670 --> 01:47:32,501
Fuck her family and friends.

1143
01:47:32,672 --> 01:47:34,833
I'll kill them. One by one.

1144
01:47:35,175 --> 01:47:37,166
Next year, she won't even be a memory.

1145
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,437
Robert, you always amaze me.

1146
01:47:39,846 --> 01:47:41,609
Me? Thank you.

1147
01:47:42,115 --> 01:47:44,675
But I got to hand it to you, Danny.

1148
01:47:44,851 --> 01:47:47,342
That was brilliant work back there.

1149
01:47:48,288 --> 01:47:49,516
What?

1150
01:47:49,856 --> 01:47:51,016
The van.

1151
01:47:51,191 --> 01:47:53,785
It was beautiful, clean, swift.

1152
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:56,690
Witnesses will say we
were never near it.

1153
01:47:56,863 --> 01:47:58,194
I like your style.

1154
01:47:58,365 --> 01:48:00,356
You know, you remind me of me.

1155
01:48:00,801 --> 01:48:02,530
I thought you set that up.

1156
01:48:02,702 --> 01:48:04,135
Didn't you--

1157
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,198
What the hell?

1158
01:48:11,044 --> 01:48:11,976
What is it?

1159
01:48:27,727 --> 01:48:28,694
Hello?

1160
01:48:32,065 --> 01:48:33,396
It's for you.

1161
01:48:39,339 --> 01:48:41,330
