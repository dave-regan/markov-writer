1
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,517
<i>Between the years</i>
<i>when the oceans drank Atlantis</i>

2
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,598
<i>and the rise of the sons of Arius,</i>

3
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,109
<i>there was an age undreamed of,</i>

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,835
<i>when shining kingdoms</i>
<i>lay spread across the world. </i>

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,112
<i>Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian,</i>
<i>sword in hand. </i>

6
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,119
<i>It is I, his chronicler,</i>
<i>who knows well his saga. </i>

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,676
<i>Now, let me tell you of</i>
<i>the days of high adventure. </i>

8
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,311
- I think we made the merchant angry.
- Are you surprised?

9
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,910
- But we didn't steal everything he had.
- We didn't have time.

10
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,315
- Why aren't they trying to kill us?
- Maybe they want to capture us,

11
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,000
then torture us to death.

12
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,036
Conan, help!

13
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,595
- Do you know who I am?
- Taramis.

14
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,873
- Queen Taramis.
- Not my queen.

15
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,835
You have a queen?
But you are a Cimmerian.

16
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,428
The Cimmerians have no rulers.

17
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,279
You're a barbarian.
You live free in the world.

18
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,756
You owe allegiance to no one.
Is that not so?

19
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,350
It is and it always will be.

20
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,994
- What do you want?
- I need your help.

21
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,953
You don't know what I'd give you
if you help me.

22
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
You have nothing that I want.

23
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,955
You were praying, Conan.
What were you praying for?

24
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,112
Look at the shrine.

25
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,595
See what you were praying for.

26
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,200
What is there, Conan?

27
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,151
Think.

28
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,751
Show me the desire in your deepest heart.

29
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,795
- Valeria!
- Where is this Valeria?

30
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,670
- With Crom.
- Your god.

31
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,075
She sits by the side of my god.

32
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,558
What I want, you cannot give me.

33
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,712
- Yes, I can.
- You can bring back the dead?

34
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,391
Do as I ask of you and I will.

35
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,316
Wake.

36
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,108
- And remember.
- Tell me what I must do.

37
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,430
Soon.

38
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,636
Conan! Look!

39
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,280
Doesn't that animal look familiar?

40
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,956
I think it does. I'm sorry about
what happened the last time.

41
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,950
They love us!

42
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,830
We will drink to Dagoth,
the dreaming god.

43
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:12,512
- What do you want me to do for you?
- To bring back the woman you love?

44
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,117
It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

45
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,119
that a woman child born with a certain
mark must make a perilous journey.

46
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,595
It is her destiny.

47
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,679
My niece Jehnna has such a mark.

48
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,916
- I want you to take her on that journey.
- To where?

49
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,600
Jehnna will show you.

50
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,759
From the day she was born,
she's been prepared for this.

51
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,635
There is a key she must find,
a key only she can touch,

52
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,150
as it was written in the scrolls of Skelos.

53
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,429
- Where is it?
- In a castle.

54
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,269
- Guarded?
- By a wizard called Toth-Amon.

55
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,712
- By a wizard?
- That frightens you.

56
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,510
You're afraid of magic.

57
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,834
And you will have to deal with it.

58
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,749
What good is a sword against sorcery?

59
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,759
- Then you're afraid to go?
- No. I will find a way.

60
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,271
- What does this key unlock?
- A treasure.

61
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,317
A jewelled horn. Only she can procure it.

62
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,915
Only she can lead you to it.

63
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,555
And when she has it,
you'll bring her back to me.

64
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,280
Then you will have your reward.

65
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,876
We shall both have everything we want...
through magic.

66
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,228
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

67
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,273
- It's only a dream. It's only a dream.
- No, I saw...

68
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,868
A dream. Only a dream.

69
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,310
- Be still. Lie down.
- I saw it.

70
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,995
- I saw it again.
- No, you saw nothing.

71
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,680
A nightmare.
Imaginings out of excitement.

72
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,677
Go back to sleep.

73
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,029
Tomorrow you start your journey.

74
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,630
You'll need all your strength.
Your destiny is at hand.

75
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,038
All our destinies are at hand,
even Conan's,

76
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,914
- though he doesn't yet know it.
- We don't need him, my queen.

77
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,034
I don't need the captain of the guard
to steal a key. That is a task for a thief.

78
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,792
What I need you for is to see that this dear
child is returned safely to the palace

79
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,435
with both the treasure
and her virginity intact.

80
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,269
I will protect them both.

81
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,516
You'd better, my friend, for she must be
a virgin when she's returned to me,

82
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,950
so she can be properly sacrificed.

83
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,350
One other thing, Bombaata.

84
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,552
It is not wise to have the king of thieves
near the treasure.

85
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,117
So when the key is in my niece's hand,
I want your sword in Conan's heart.

86
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,119
Have the Elite Guard follow. They will
strike at the right moment to help you.

87
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,912
Conan must die.

88
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,914
Do you think he's handsome?

89
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,475
Very ugly.

90
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,558
No, not him. Conan.

91
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,149
Can't you judge for yourself?

92
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,717
But how can I?
How many times have I seen a man?

93
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,429
A real man.

94
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,996
All I've seen is you.

95
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,834
Meaning no insult to you, Bombaata.

96
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,955
Yes. He is handsome.

97
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,192
Conan, wait! We must go this way.

98
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,438
- Not yet.
- But you have to obey me.

99
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,430
Weren't you told?
There are rules to every game.

100
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,354
I believe you.
But there's magic in this game

101
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,392
and I have to be able
to fight it with magic.

102
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,476
Akiro!

103
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,989
Crom!

104
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,839
- What are they going to do?
- Have lunch.

105
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,835
Those savages should thank me,
sparing them a terrible stomachache.

106
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,669
Why would they wanna eat someone
as old and as sour as you?

107
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,918
They thought if they digested me,
my magic would be in their blood.

108
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,679
At least they coulda washed you first.

109
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,435
- I need you.
- I'm yours.

110
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,236
Tell me more about this key.

111
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,477
Oh, it's not an ordinary key. It's a jewel.

112
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,990
- A jewel?
- Yes. The Heart of Ahriman.

113
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,550
- Well, can it be worn?
- Only by me.

114
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,035
No one else dare touch it.

115
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,914
If there is anything here that you like,
try not to take it.

116
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,032
I know when to steal and when not to.

117
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,916
Hit her. Get her!

118
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,600
- What did she do?
- She came with bandits to raid us.

119
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,234
The others are dead. Now it's her turn,

120
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,794
after we have our fun with her.

121
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,349
Don't kill her too soon!

122
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,189
- Save her!
- Thieves should be hanged.

123
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,951
Conan, there are six of them against her.

124
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,595
One, two, three... I think you're right.

125
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,188
And she's tied to the stake.

126
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,675
Do something!

127
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,598
- I think we made a friend.
- Wait here.

128
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,876
What do you want?

129
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,195
- To come with you.
- Be off!

130
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,598
- Let me speak to Conan.
- I said be off.

131
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,356
Leave.

132
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:42,315
I swear that if Conan will let me ride
with him, I will give my life for him.

133
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,630
We shall see.

134
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,471
The castle of Toth-Amon. It holds the key.

135
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,355
Come bring her, Conan.

136
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,393
- We leave now.
- In the morning.

137
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,394
- I'm the leader here.
- Lead in the morning.

138
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,159
It will be better. We must rest.

139
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,430
My thinking exactly.

140
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,030
Sleep.

141
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,028
In the morning you will touch
the Heart of Ahriman.

142
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,754
The first to do so in a thousand years.

143
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,916
Look!

144
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,875
Akiro, where is she?

145
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,950
In there!

146
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,952
- Who took her?
- A giant bird.

147
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,833
A bird of smoke.

148
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,030
Into the boat!

149
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,355
Somebody should stay
and watch the horses.

150
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,357
Malak!

151
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,835
I didn't mean me.

152
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,915
I'm rowing!

153
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,715
Too late, my friends.

154
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,110
But come... come anyway.

155
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,557
How do we get in?
Is there another entrance?

156
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,593
Under here is a way in.

157
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,153
- You mean under the water?
- You can stay here if you like.

158
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,914
Alone?

159
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,036
They need me.

160
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,596
Bombaata.

161
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,635
Wizard it open.

162
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,509
Fine magician you are.
Go back to juggling apples.

163
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,558
Get up! Get him!

164
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,996
That's exactly what I would have done.
Exactly.

165
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,672
There are only two left, wizard,
and you're behind one of them.

166
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,189
Which one?

167
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,436
- No! Not here!
- It's us!

168
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,076
I need you!

169
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,080
- Bombaata...
- It's all right.

170
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,876
Crom!

171
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,759
Out! Out of here quick!

172
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,269
- Hurry, hurry!
- Quick! Out!

173
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,995
All an illusion.

174
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,875
Help! Bombaata, help me!

175
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,628
Bombaata, where are you?

176
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,593
Put me down, do you hear me?
Put me down!

177
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,556
Look out, you fool!

178
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,716
- Why?
- I thought you were going to hurt the girl.

179
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,955
This is one of the queen's guards.

180
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:57,913
- Why did they attack us?
- Not by her order.

181
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,755
Wait, wait. This is much better.
Akiro's own magic mixture.

182
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,915
Let me help you.

183
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,272
- What do you think you're doing?
- Covering your wound.

184
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,595
My wound is lower.

185
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,678
We don't want an infection to spread.

186
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,916
I'll spread your head open.

187
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,354
Is this what the world has come to?

188
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,670
You try to help somebody
and what do you get instead of thanks?

189
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,235
Threats.

190
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,115
Now, yell if it hurts.

191
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,315
I suppose nothing hurts you.

192
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,590
Only pain.

193
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,958
After we return to Shadizar,
what will you do?

194
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,273
I'll find my kingdom
and a queen to sit beside me.

195
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,556
What kingdom?

196
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,558
The promise I was kingdomed.

197
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,440
The kingdom I was promised.

198
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,077
- What queen?
- Valeria.

199
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,033
- Valeria...
- Valeria.

200
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,158
What is she like, this... Valeria?

201
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,879
Do you see this woman over there?

202
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,959
- Zula?
- Valeria is like her.

203
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:10,558
She doesn't look like her,
but she has the same... spirit.

204
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:17,030
The same... The same...

205
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,310
Strength?

206
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,715
And she's a warrior too?

207
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,195
A great warrior.

208
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,396
A great woman.

209
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,355
Could there ever be...
anyone else but her?

210
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,276
Another queen?

211
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:41,115
Lot on your knife.

212
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,879
Not on your life.

213
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,709
Excuse me. I must get up now.

214
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,510
How do you feel?

215
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,550
Welcome.

216
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,953
You are welcome.

217
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:27,513
I didn't know women could be warriors.

218
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,915
All my tribe are warriors.

219
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,918
Well, it seems that
men like women warriors.

220
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,996
Some.

221
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,758
Do you think that I could ever be one?

222
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,800
I could teach you how to use this.

223
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,432
Yes. Please.

224
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,708
Now, the power is in the wrists.

225
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,195
Oh, I see. Like this?

226
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,029
That's right. They've got to stay loose.

227
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,469
It takes practice and strength.

228
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,354
Wait!

229
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,436
Hold on.

230
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,076
If you're going to learn how to fight,
then learn with a real weapon.

231
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,475
Not with a toothpick.

232
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,229
Here. I'll show you. Stand like this.

233
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,434
Yes. You do it. Try it.

234
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,835
And then swing it over your head.

235
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,914
I'll help you. Swing over your head.

236
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,916
Good.

237
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,358
Now you're ready to take on anybody.

238
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,435
How do you attract a man?

239
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,790
What I mean is...

240
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,913
suppose you set your heart on somebody,

241
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,076
what would you do to get him?

242
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,873
Grab him! And take him!

243
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,752
You'd grab him and... and take him?

244
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,672
Take him, like that!

245
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,472
- What did she mean?
- What did she say?

246
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:52,551
Well, she said that if she wanted a man,
she'd reach out and take him.

247
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,270
Good idea.

248
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:00,838
But then what? I mean, you've got him.
What do you do with him?

249
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,557
That's easy. You see, you just...

250
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,276
You...

251
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,438
You see, in order for a man
to really know a woman

252
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,196
and for her to know him, they have to...

253
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,280
they have to... to join.

254
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:24,273
Join?

255
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:30,357
Get together.

256
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,996
You see, he has to take his... his...

257
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,357
and grab her by the...

258
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,870
There you are, joined.

259
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,389
I mean, how do you think flowers grow?

260
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,477
- Through this?
- Yes.

261
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,433
- Is this the only way?
- Yes.

262
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,953
- We can't go around it?
- I go where I feel myself led.

263
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,435
So I've noticed.

264
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,830
That way.

265
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:31,028
Shouldn't one of us
go back and stand guard?

266
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,796
Bombaata.

267
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,636
Together.

268
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,515
Here, let me help.

269
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,430
Malak, go inside and see if there's a lock.

270
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,835
- You mean in there?
- Go!

271
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,391
I found something. Let go. Easy.

272
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,751
"It is written in the scrolls of Skelos

273
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,079
that the horn will be
found by a woman child. "

274
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:58,715
"A virgin, who will have a mark upon her. "

275
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:18,353
"And when the horn is placed once more
in the forehead of the dreaming god,

276
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,555
Dagoth will arise. "

277
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:25,150
"Then let men fear. "

278
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,315
"Death to the world. "

279
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,238
"The woman child will be sacrificed. "

280
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,553
- Stop her!
- Be silent!

281
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:52,556
Crom!

282
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,115
Death to the world.

283
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:03,595
Life for Valeria.

284
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,839
The girl's destiny isn't only
to deliver the horn.

285
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,269
It's just writing on a wall.

286
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,119
She is to be killed. Sacrificed.

287
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:21,190
We shall see, destiny or not.

288
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:25,435
Everybody out!

289
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,596
Out!

290
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,195
Wait! It's worth a fortune!

291
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:11,191
- We come in peace.
- Then let us go in peace.

292
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:17,630
Let the girl come forward.
We've been waiting for her all our lives.

293
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:22,759
We are the keepers of the horn.
It belongs to us.

294
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:25,077
No longer.

295
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:27,395
- Who are you?
- Conan.

296
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,115
I have heard of you.

297
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:41,117
Do you know the legend
written on the wall of the crypt?

298
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,196
From the day of my birth.

299
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:46,392
Then you know what will happen
if the horn is placed back

300
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,239
in the forehead of Dagoth.

301
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:51,476
The god will live again.

302
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:57,470
And we who give him life will stand by his
right hand and rule the world with him.

303
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,718
You will die in the great evil
that will come from his rebirth!

304
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,868
- We will control him.
- No one is able to control him!

305
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,357
His power and his evil are too great!

306
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,755
Give us the girl or we'll take her!

307
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,030
Enough talk!

308
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,870
Back to the crypt!

309
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,270
Bombaata, get out!

310
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,630
Out! Let's get out of here!

311
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,559
Behind the dragon there's a tunnel.
It could be our only way out.

312
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,830
The jewel. Take the jewel.

313
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,035
Hurry, hurry.

314
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,916
That way.

315
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,194
Malak! Malak, come on!

316
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,955
It's the leader. He's a wizard.

317
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:30,515
- He's forcing the mouth open.
- Well, stop him. Kill him or something.

318
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:36,839
- My dagger is gone. You kill him.
- Not me. It's bad luck to kill a wizard.

319
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,999
Wait. There is a better way
to take care of a wizard.

320
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,590
Well done, Akiro.

321
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,750
Into the tunnel.

322
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:35,958
Don't stop. Hurry! Hurry!

323
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,990
Run! Run!

324
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,039
- Where are the others?
- They're coming. Don't worry. Go!

325
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,115
- They've gone.
- Taken their horses.

326
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,276
Or been captured. Let's flee.

327
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:13,709
Wait.

328
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,195
Bombaata took her.

329
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,593
Taramis planned it from the beginning.

330
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,633
We get the horn, her guards will kill us,

331
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,797
and Bombaata takes the girl
and the horn back to her.

332
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,198
- And her promise to you?
- A lie.

333
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:42,075
- Where are we going?
- To Shadizar.

334
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:45,158
- What for?
- To stop Jehnna's sacrifice.

335
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:48,989
But it's her destiny. It can't be stopped.

336
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,554
- You don't have to come.
- I will.

337
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,035
- I will.
- I won't!

338
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:56,515
I mean, what's in it for us?

339
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:01,673
What are we? Some charitable
institution? We're thieves!

340
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:04,155
Go! I won't help!

341
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:20,119
Hey, wait for me!
You know you can't do without me!

342
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,756
Wait, Conan, wait!

343
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,955
Do you have the treasure?

344
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,990
Bring it to me.

345
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:19,916
Reserves to guard the palace.

346
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:23,715
There must be hundreds of them
around it. We can't get in there.

347
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,195
Well, you can't say we didn't try.

348
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,796
- The front gate can't be the only way in.
- Oh, it isn't...

349
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:33,795
Malak?

350
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,277
At the bottom, behind the waterfall,
there's an entrance.

351
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:51,109
It used to be an exit. My cousin's sister's
brother dug his way out there,

352
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:54,152
when he was a prisoner in Shadizar.

353
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:19,232
Today is your birthday.
All of Shadizar is celebrating.

354
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,716
Drink.

355
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:29,513
To life. To Dagoth.

356
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:32,270
To Dagoth.

357
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,796
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

358
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:20,115
My cousin's sister's brother
never said anything about bars.

359
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:22,117
How do we get back up?

360
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:26,279
The bars were put up after
your sister's brother's cousin escaped!

361
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,109
Cousin's sister's brother. How many
times do I have to tell you that?

362
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:34,791
- You said your sister's brother's cousin!
- Who cares who it is?

363
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,388
What difference does it make?

364
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,632
At the first sign of life in our god,
the girl must be sacrificed.

365
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:11,276
Or, as the scrolls of Skelos say,
a catastrophe will befall us.

366
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,155
Oh, Dagoth, god of gods.

367
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,669
Power above all power.

368
01:24:47,240 --> 01:24:49,390
Kill her!

369
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:53,270
Save the girl!

370
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,911
Kill her! Kill her! She must be sacrificed.

371
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:40,356
Get back!

372
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,909
Down the steps!

373
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,152
His horn is his life! Tear out the horn!

374
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,114
I need a captain of the guards.

375
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:10,835
I see no reason why a woman
wouldn't do as well as a man.

376
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,833
- You.
- Me?

377
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,110
Come here.

378
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,151
I understand that every king or queen
must have a fool.

379
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:47,871
- Do I qualify?
- More than qualify.

380
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:03,079
Will the world's greatest
wizard come forward, please?

381
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,550
At your service.

382
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,159
One cannot rule without wisdom.

383
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,750
- Let me instruct you in the fine art of...
- Later.

384
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:50,834
Rule Shadizar with me.

385
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,350
I will have my own kingdom,
my own queen.

386
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,833
<i>So it was that Conan</i>
<i>mourned his lost Valeria. </i>

387
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:45,471
<i>At length, he sought adventure</i>
<i>in distant lands</i>

388
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:51,277
<i>and trod the jewelled thrones of</i>
<i>the earth beneath his sandalled feet,</i>

389
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,678
<i>until at last he found his own kingdom</i>

390
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:58,951
<i>and wore his crown</i>
<i>upon a troubled brow. </i>

391
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,479
